         "#1 Cochran Buick GMC of Monroeville",
         "I bought my car at Cochran and the salesman was excellent. That was two years ago and I've taken the car back two times since for routine maintenance. \n     The people at Cochran have become kind of snotty. They think they're doing you a favor by taking your money. I don't know if they've always been like this and I just didn't notice, or if it's something new, but I'm really disappointed and I'm looking for another dealership.\n      I had my car serviced a couple of weeks ago and they did some things to the car that alarmed me, so I called the service advisor. Then I called him again. Then I called the main number twice, then I called the manager, then I emailed GM and the dealership. To this day no one from Cochran has ever returned my calls. They've gone out of their way to let me know that they don't want me as a customer. I'm planning on getting a new car in a little over a year from now and hopefully I can find a dependable dealership by then + Service here is definitely NOT #1. \nI bought a SAAB here in 2008. At the time there were questions of ownership of SAAB due to the sale of SAAB by GM. So that was my first mistake...but the salesperson assured us that we'd have NO troubles getting parts service in the future, so we went with it.  Within the first year of ownership we moved from the east end to the South Hills.  We assumed we'd be able to utilize one of the several Cochran locations within 2!mikes of both our home (west liberty) or our w\nNew jobs (Robinson).  NOPE.  We were told there was only ONE person certified for SAAB repairs, so for five years we've been hauling all the way out to monroeville for service, passing 3-4 Cochran dealerships in our neighborhood along the way.  \nEach time I needed service, I would always ask if there was anyway if we could go to the service center nearby and without any apology, was always rudely told no. As if what I was asking was so outrageous.  Is it that hard to certify one more guy in the south hills???\nAs for parts being available, there is a crack in the hinge of the passenger door that I asked to be fixed.  When I took it in, I was told it was on back order and would take a few weeks.  So I waited a month, heard nothing and called to follow up. The woman who answered was rude (this was typical) and said it still wasn't in yet and implied I should not call back; they would call when the part came in.  That was about two years ago.  Still never got that call. \nRecently my vehicle had a major failure. We had to have it towed to Monroeville.  They told us what the problem was, said it wasn't covered by warranty, and would cost thousands.  I repeatedly asked for an itemized estimate and a better explanation for why it wasn't covered under the power train warranty and was flat out ignored.  Once again the part was on back order. I requested via email three times for an itemized estimate so that I could make an educated decision about whether to repair the car, take it elsewhere, or just get a new one.  The dealership clearly was ignoring my requests and basically holding my car hostage for three weeks!! If they gave me the info I needed there was a chance i would take it elsewhere and they'd lose my money. (Customer service at its best).   I asked if they offered a loaner from the dealer since they would have the car for so long (which I don't think is that unreasonable) and was denied if course.  That would be actual customer service. \nThen, when my car was ready, I figured at the very least they'd wash it for me.  Haha.  Silly me.  \n\nThe moral of the story is, buyer beware.  This dealership is super nice when you buy your car, but once you come back for service, it's a whole new ball game. I am in the market for a new car now, and it would be super convenient for me to go to Cochran in Robinson since I can almost walk there from work, but I feel I'd just be made a fool of again. + Update: I had to return for a second recall notice. I called and made an appointment for today (1\\/18). Last week, someone called and said I missed my appointment, saying it was the 8th. I said, \"No. I scheduled it for 7:30AM on 1\\/18.\" They said okay. I then get an email saying my appointment was at 11AM on 1\\/18. I had to call and get that fixed because it was for 7:30AM, not 11AM. They told me it would take an hour for the recall to be fixed--I made the appointment first thing in the morning so I could make it to another appointment later in the morning. 11AM comes around and they still haven't called to tell me it was ready. They finally called at about 11:45AM after I had called and left a message.\nI get to the dealership and there are 5 employees behind their computers at the service center. It takes a solid 30 seconds for anyone to speak to me. Then another 30 seconds for someone to ask what they could help me with.\nTime after time I am disappointed with #1 Cochran. They really need to be better organized and train their employees on customer service skills. The cashier was their only saving grace--she was friendly and polite. I am never returning here. I would rather drive an extra hour to a different center to get serviced than deal with Cochran again. + DO NOT get your car serviced at Cochran Monroeville. All of the good service advisors and mechanics have left. The place is now run by misfits that do shoddy work and damage your car while it is in for service. I made NINE trips to their service dept this summer. All I wanted was for them to repair my air conditioner and return my car in the same condition it was in when I dropped it off for service. I guess I was expecting too much.  Don't go to Robinson for service either.  The woman service manager is loud, sarcastic and condescending. She embarrasses everyone in the waiting room. + I took my 07 lacrosse in for an oil change and a steering noise.  Come to find out they didn't change my oil, I was charged? The noise was still there, the explanation I got was \"that's normal\". I should have went to nick's automotive in penn hills. I would have gave this dealership a no star but in order to write a review, you have to mark something. I'm very disappointed  with the service and experience at this dealership. Where is \"Rob\" when you need him? How can you advertise \"number one Cochran\", when your service is sub par at best. I would think twice to get your car serviced at this place, if you do, then question and double check the service you just had done. You have so many other dealership in the area or just take your vehicle to your local neighborhood shop! I definitely wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone. All you have to do is read the previous reviews on this dealership, this alone should make you think twice. + Terrible. I bought a used car from them three years ago. Once the deal was done, I was persona non grata. Service is slow and inconsiderate. All the good service representatives have left. My last visit they tried to hose me for over five thousand dollars of repairs to my car that it didn't actually need. To add insult to injury, the expensive auto butler service that I bought with the car was done before my minor scheduled repair so there were grimy fingerprints all over the hood of the car. The promise to top off all your fluids is also a lie because I ran out of washer fluid the next day. I will never return to Cochran. If I need dealer repair, I'll find another GM dealer. And in a year when I'm ready to buy another car, it will definitely be elsewhere. + got a quote for a new car with their new best price quote.  Turned out that I saved $2000 by buying the car in VA. + no problem dropping off, but waited 30 minutes to get my loaner. and very little was said to me by anyone during the wait. other than that, James and the team did the work. then when I went to pick up, I was handed my keys to go 'fetch'' my car myself. interesting. not a big deal, but not up to the usual Cochran experience."

         "Bought a new truck and was lied to from the start. The GM Dale Taylor is very good at saying one thing and then never following up and seeing things through. He swore to me that they'd only go to one bank for my financing so I wouldn't have a ton of inquiries on my credit report but they did them all anyways. He promised to have my tailgate fixed after I took the truck back in and showed him where the bed liner was rubbing off the paint off the tailgate, and he never follow through on that either. When I complained that the crappy pin striping they add to and then overcharge you on on all of their vehicles was pealing off after just a  month, they failed to fix that too after saying they would. \n\nThis place SUCKS. All they care about is the sale, not YOU! + We had a great experience selling our vehicle. We dealt with Nate and the dealership manager. They were quick and efficient in gathering information and analyzing the vehicle. They offered a very fair price and gave us exceptional customer service. We will be back to purchase our next vehicle from them! + Booked an appointment for a test drive on a car that was a solid deal. Got a phone call confirming my appointment as I was on my way to the dealership. (A 15 minute drive at most). The car I wanted was parked right out front with an open space next to it... Wow these guys are really on the ball. Walked in and saw a board with my name on it for the 10 AM slot followed by five or six names to test drive the car.  I was first on the list. Imagine my surprise when they asked me to have a seat in the waiting room because they were currently running someone's credit who is buying the car as we speak. Based on the list of names on the board, I would say they did that five or six more times today. Their sales person Steve was helpful in showing me other cars, however they were nothing of the kind I was looking for. This entire process took an hour and a half out of my day. I know the board was for just that car because that car was going to go quick as it was rare and an extremely good deal... The sales people told me to \"not talk about the car or else other people would see that I was interested and other people might want to buy it\". This is great advice, except for the massive board in the front of the show room that has all the list of people that want to look at the car, as well as the fact that they were already in the process of selling it. Aside from basically being baited into the dealership, I would say they are nice people and were more than willing to talk to me about different options as I would consider a different vehicle... The general manager was next to me within seconds after I decided I wasn't waiting in the waiting room and was more than happy to explain things to me. I'll be putting out already you shortly on the dealership that did win my business today and sold a $25,000 vehicle when I was in the market for a $13,000 vehicle. They also did this with no money down and a monthly payment that is lower on a vehicle that is 12 years newer with the warranty. If you were going to beat people in on a sports car, at least have other sports cars in your inventory to show them... Someone looking for a two-seat roadster is not going to buy a truck, or a massive SUV. I will say that Steve did tell me they have a used a lot on the lower part of the dealership, but that he wouldn't sell me any of those cars as they are a risky trade... They were in the price range I was originally in and to be honest I probably would've bought one of those cars from him and he said he wouldn't do that because they are very high mileage and do not have a warranty.\n\nOverall I would say it was a moderate experience and that for my time I was at least able to learn a couple of tricks of the trade... I wasn't thrilled with the bait and switch especially 10 minutes before hand, I would've understood if I got a confirmation call a day ahead of time and showed up and the car was gone, but with 10 minutes lead time I would say that they were already in the process of financing while they were calling me to see if I was coming to test drive the car. I've been it way worse and way better dealers, and as of today I will be a Subaru customer for life however I do appreciate the fine work that Steve did. \n\nMy mom bought two cars off of this dealership and was with me when this happened and was just as shocked as I was, so I will chalk that up to \"stuff happens\". Personally I will not return to this dealership as I found others with a much better selection that have newer cars at a much better price. + I have been bringing my Buick to this facility for service for years.  I can no longer justify doing so.  There have been too many problems which have negatively impacted me.   The most prominent one is that the dealership continues to engage a Buick Service Advisor who could not be more cold, unfriendly, and detrimental to the business.  He does not look at the customer and does not know how to smile or be pleasant and engaging.  I will not embarrass him by noting his name.  His latest gaffe was to have failed to notify me of numerous service items which were needed for my vehicle.  I only discovered what was recommended upon returning home and then taking a detailed look at the invoice.  I was offered a 15% discount for these items after informing the dealership of the issue.  That will not renew my faith after a significant history of failures.  Based upon recent experiences at this division, I consider Cochran to be\n at the bottom of the pack for customer service. + I would have given them zero stars if I could have. The first bad experience with #1 Cochran was in the 90s when my mother went to purchase a GMC Suburban due to our growing family. The salesman refused to talk to her or sell her anything without her husband present. It was the 90s, and we're not talkin' the 1890s. \n\nWe decided to give them another chance because some time had passed when we were looking for a new car this year. We called ahead to ask if they had any red Cadillac Escalades, because we were likely going to be driving the car off the lot that day. They said yes, so we drove the 30 minutes to get to the dealership. Not only did they not have a red Escalade, we sat and waited as they went to \"get the car.\" They tried to push some other vehicle on us that we didn't want and we ended up leaving very irritated. Avoid this sorry excuse for a car dealership.\n\nThese people are disrespectful, sleezy scammers. + Crappy customer service, over priced cars and no wiggle room. 9 year old car with cracks in the bumper, needs a paint job for 7g. + Do not go to this dealership. After moving to Pittsburgh from Houston, I needed a dealership for service and repairs and found this one. I had a rattling noise coming from under my new GMC Canyon and brought it in to have the problem diagnosed. After driving in the car with a service rep to verify the noises coming from under the truck, I left the car with the dealer to investigate the issue at 9:00 am. I called back 8 hours later and they said my truck was ready (they didn't call me prior to inform me of what the issue was). When I came back they informed me the noise was coming from some minor clutter in my backseat (folding hunting chair), so the rattling noise under my truck was my fault, and there was nothing to be done. \n\nI will never come back to this dealership in my remaining time in Pittsburgh. In summary this dealership has the following qualities: \n- Terrible customer service\n- Dishonest assessment of vehicle issues\n\nI'm disappointed in the quality of this dealership because I had such a positive experience in Houston where I bought the truck. Hopefully I can find a more honest, reputable dealer in the future. \n\nNick"

         "My parents have been buying cars off of Donna Dunnivan for over a decade and have always been satisfied. I just got my first new car courtesy of Donna and I couldn't have been more pleased with the transaction! Things went very smoothly and she walked me through the set up even after Cochran has closed up the showrooms. She went above and beyond to get me my new vehicle that night and I have nothing but good things to say about the sale. I'm sure I'll be back to see her for my next one! + Leslie,\n\nYour and your team should review my correspondence with your dealership. You missed, and admittedly I didn't clearly elaborate on in my review, one of the key failures on Cochran's part. Dodging my review by misplacing blame on me being in Japan was a nice touch.\nThat being said, my being in Japan was largely irrelevant. I made it abundantly clear, several times, from the very first time I made contact, that I COULD NOT BE REACHED BY PHONE. I believe I mentioned this at least three times in written messages, and twice by phone (I was able to dial out using Skype). Despite this, one of your salesman, Bruce Auth, tried twice to call my phone but never reached out by email until the 6th day. My request for the build sheet was not even something that could be relayed by phone. So why was he trying to call anyway?\nI also requested a rough trade in value for my Escalade, which I provided a ridiculously in depth description of. I never received that. + I dropped my car off on a Wednesday morning for a diagnostic with John Salmon. I was told I would receive a call Thursday morning around 10 am. After not receiving that call, I proceeded to call several times over the next several days and after nobody responded, I went to the dealership but no one is there on Saturday.  After my second trip up on Monday, one of the service advisers, Jerry, looked into the situation for me.  After 10 minutes he came back and said that he doesn't know all the details, but found out that my car had been in an accident 4 days prior.  I was in shock. He had no idea why I was not informed and told me the manager, Brian, would be in touch with me.  The manager did call the next morning, but left a message without any details and just said to call him back.  Which I did an hour later, and was told he left early for the day.  He called me the next day, in the morning, and again left a message without any details.  I proceeded to call him several times throughout that day without a call back.  I left a message asking if he could meet at 4 pm, no response.  I went to the dealership at 4 pm where I received a phone call from him at 4:05 saying he was not able to meet because he was leaving and will not be in the next day either.  I told him I was there.  He came to the service station and very lightly and without detail just said my car was in an accident and that they are going to fix it. All he said it was swiped against another car, needs a new bumper, headlight, and they would fix the alternator for free. I was frustrated and demanded more detail from him as he was trying to rush me out the door to get on his way.  I stood my ground and demanded to know more details, asked why I have not been offered a loaner car, and need my car to be fixed so that it doesn't look like it was just in an accident.  He agreed, told me the car would be in the shop for another week, and sent me on my way laughing that my car would look better after everything then it did before and blaming the reason I wasn't informed about the accident on John Salmon for being out sick. I was never offered an accident report, never saw any pictures, and when I finally received my car back it had over spray all over the engine. 2.5 weeks in the shop when it was dropped off for a diagnostic. 3 trips to the dealership and lots of phone calls just trying to find out what was going on with my car. 7 days to corner the manager and find out what happened and when I'll get my car back. 2.5 weeks in the shop. Zero respect from the manager and no accident or repair reports for my records.  I will never go back there and deal with Brian, the Cadillac service manager, again.  Nor will anyone I have told my story to. Extremely unprofessional and disgusting the way that place handles business.\n\n***TL;DR: Dropped my car off for a diagnostic. They wrecked it.  Didn't tell me for 6 days and ignored all my messages. I had to corner the manager, Brian, in the service station and demand to know what happened, when I'll get my car back, and a loaner car since they did not offer up either. 2.5 weeks to get my car back and had over spray all over it since they had to replace the bumper and headlights.  This place is awful.*** + I had to schedule an appointment due to the airbag recall. I used the website, which was straight forward. I dropped off the car at 8am and I requested that my car be fixed by 1pm that day. When I called at 1pm to check the status, the car was ready. It was nice to know they were able to keep their promised. + We called to ask if they had any red Escalades because we were ready to buy that day. We didn't want to wait because our other vehicle had broken down beyond reasonable repair. They said yes so we made the 30 min trip to Monroeville. We get there and they try to show us other vehicles. After about 10 minutes, we were told they didn't have any red Escalades and that it'd have to be ordered. We walked out. Wasted an hour of driving for this crap dealership and service. + Update on my review. Scott the initial salesperson has been in contact with me and will rectify this situation! I recommend #1 Cochran for any future auto needs + I recently bought another car from Donna Dunnivan at #1 Cochran, and I can't rave enough about the wonderful service she provided me yet again!  DJ, as she is fondly called, always goes the extra mile to get her customers every answer needed in purchasing a car. I had the same experience in 2005 when I bought my Saab from her.  Her attention to the service of her customers truly makes her an invaluable and an incredible car sales person! I used to dread the experience of buying cars before meeting DJ.  I no longer feel that way with Donna Dunnivan at #1 Cochran.  I refer many to her to buy cars, and they always come back to me sharing similar experiences.  I will continue to buy cars from her for a long time to come!! + If you're planning on buying a Cadillac, See Lee Plimpton. I just signed the paperwork for my second Cadillac from Lee. I plan on always buying my vehicles from him. + Always satisfied with Cochran service especially the express service they have now. I love the fact that you dont need an appointment to get an oil change and tire rotation. Makes simple services move quickly as they have you out in under an hour. Havent had any complaints with their service. keep up the good work! + It was WONDERFUL!  We were up for our daughter's wedding.  Local service center in Northern Virginia missed a problem, then the check engine light came on during our trip.  We made it to Murrysville on a Monday, but our daughter's wedding was that coming Saturday, and we had a lot of running to do.  We could not be happier with Cochran of Monroeville; they really are #1!  They fixed a bad water pump and found another more dangerous problem--the front axle.  They put it on the rack and showed my husband, who has worked on cars over his lifetime, and he was shocked.  He said it could have broken and caused us to wreck.  We travel back to Virginia on the turnpike at higher speeds.  Thank you SO much for not only getting us in quickly and thoroughly checking out our vehicle, but also keeping us safe!  The price was reasonable (really appreciated right before a wedding), and to top it off Cochran of Monroeville also washed our car.  Trust me when I say that not every dealership does that anymore!  Thank you!!! :)\nElaine Lee"

         "Always have a great experience here whether its from sales to service. Ron Harris in sales is the man. He's always informative and always wants you to make an educated decision. Their service department is excellent as well. Always timely and cant complain when they give you a free car wash. Go Cochran! Happy customer as always + I have two Hyundais - A 2012 Tucson, and a 2012 Azera. I have had them both serviced by Cochran Hyundai many times. Their customer service and their work has always been exemplary. This specific time, my Tucson's check engine light came on, just before we were to take a 1000 mile driving trip. I brought it in, knowing that there would be a charge for the analysis required to determine the cause of the alert, plus whatever repair was needed to correct it. After analysis, the cause was determined to be minor, and in fact, had already been corrected. The alert was \"in history.\" They cleared the alert, and I was good to go. The best thing about the experience, however, was the fact that they waived the analysis charge! I'm certain the mechanic had to spend time performing this task, and they certainly put my mind at ease before my driving trip. Thank you, Cochran Hyundai! + This review has nothing to do with the dealership in itself.  I got my car from there 6 months ago and really like my salesman who was kind and transparent.\n\nThis review is about the service center which has me HIGHLY disappointed and here is why.\n\nOriginally going there to have my inspection sticker put back on after my windshield was replaced, I was waiting with my son in the lounge area.  I overheard a service rep come out and talk to a gentleman, aged 80 (I know because we started talking while we waited).  They told him \"your insurance expired 2 weeks ago, and its Saturday, and we can't complete our work until this is resolved\"\n\nThis man just stood there, he was confused and asked when it could have expired and he must not have replaced the new one, etc, etc.  The service men just stood there staring at him and pretty much nothing else.  \n\nAt this moment, I stepped in and said \"did you call the agency??\"  Serviceman; \"No, its Saturday, they are most likely closed\"\n\nI asked the Genteleman who was clearly confused and not sure of next move what his insurance carrier was.  I pulled out my phone, called the 1-800 number and asked the insurance rep to fax his policy over.  She asked me to put him on the phone for confirmation and this step took less than 3 minutes and the policy was faxed.  done deal.\n\nThis is something they could have easily done, make a phone call, think outside of the box.  But not once was it even offered to this kind man who was waiting for an inspection.  \n\nI understand insurance is needed, however, i also understand the common core of customer service.  They lack it highly.\n\nAnd to boot.  I was told I had a bolt in my tire.  They gave me a quote of $163.73 for a new tire.\n\nI went to my neighborhood service center to ask if they could quote me and they said \"there is no need for a new tire! this is in great condition.  Just needs a patch job\"  \n\nThey did this and I am good to go.\n\nCochran Hyundai SERVICE CENTER should really work on their soft skills and customer management.  I helped them with their job and they still managed to try to be vultures when it came to me.\n\nHighly disappointed and surprised with their audacity to not offer patch, but instead try to get a brand new tire out of me.\n\nNever ever will I ever go back for service. EVER.\n\nI hope everyone in the corporation reads this.  it needs to be heard. + Great experience buying my new car here. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I got exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted. No one tried to push me into anything I didn't want. I drove in with my old car and a few hours later left with my new car. + So myself, wife and daughter pull up to this dealership in her Hyundai Sonata which she LOVES and was also her first Hyundai to check out and test drive the new Hyundai Genesis when it first came out. \n\nNot only did no one came out to greet us while we walked around and looked at the Genesis's parked outside. But once we went inside grabbed a brochure, looked around the inside and sat in the car (which is very very nice by the way!) still no one asked to help us and we were completely ignored! \n\nYou sell Hyundai's not Bentley's! Mind you there were two other customers in the whole dealership and six salesman. Four of which were just sitting around!\n\nWe left without any service at all. \n\nI've had better service at Bentley of Pittsburgh! Not that I can afford one. LOL!\n\nCochran, you are defiantly NOT #1! + I just purchased my car yesterday. I love it! It was the best experience I have had at a car dealership. I had done my research on the cars they had prior to coming in. I knew exactly what I wanted. The gentleman that helped me and my husband was a new sales person. He was so friendly and explained every step as we went through the process. He was so helpful. He was also very honest. He showed me everything in the car. He told me about the car not coming with a spare tire because the new models have a kit to fix a tired that is better than the donut tire. He said that he wanted to make sure I knew so that I wouldn't be surprised. He answered all of my questions. He was very knowledgeable about the cars. I walked away purchasing a 2016 Hyundai Elantra. I love it so far! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. I love this car! I had the 2000 model that was given to me for my high school graduation. It was bought brand new by my aunt in 2000 and in 2010 it was still amazing for my first car. It is still running and has been for 15 years. I am so glad to have a Hyundai back in my life! I'd recommend #1 Cochran to anyone! + We have taken our cars there multiple times for minor repairs and regular maintenance. All of the repair advisors especially Bob and Rex have been great, ensuring that the cost (if not covered by warranty) would reasonable. They even only charged for parts when my wife's side view mirror was sideswiped when she was parked. It cost way less than what she was quoted at Pep Boys and well below our deductible. The service is really good, even though they are often busy and the waiting area is well kept. I have been to other locations and repair places and this is by far the best for Hyundai service. + I've purchased 2 vehicles from this dealership and (prior to my second purchase) turned my parents and friend onto this dealership (and both of them purchased from the same dealer @ this dearlership).\n\nThe shopping process is what it is... a P.I.T.A...\n\nFor me, It's not so much the dealership aspect as it is the service department.\nPROS:\n*Friendly staff;\n*My appointments tend to run on time;\n*Free guest WIFI (but it is filtered). \n\nCONS:\n*Service dept hours!!\nThey maintain the craziest (and most slim) service hours of which I have ever heard.\nThey have no hours after approx 4pm!\nDon't people have to work???\nThis is absolutely infuriating to me and was never the case with any of my other cars.\n*They Nickel & Dime you for everything outside of your warranty, but ALL dealerships do this.\n\nIf they want to be in\\/of a better score\\/range, IMO... they're going to need to open up those service hours for folks who have to work for a living! + Total joke. Don't let them get your email address on their mailing lists, because they will continuously spam you and try to sell you a car you were never interested in at the first place (claiming \"updated pricing\" and the like).\n\nI tried to trade in a car here with autotrader, and they sent me emails (and phone calls) from a customer service specialist saying that they have an excellent trade in program that will do an inspection with you on site detailing exactly why your quote is the way it is, with comparison to blue book estimates. It sounded great, but this place is all talk.\n\nWhat I got instead when I showed up were grumpy people who had no idea my appointment existed, who gave me a ridiculously lowball offer (seriously, I could've crashed that car into a concrete barrier, called somebody, and gotten them to tow it away for scrap for more money than they offered), and offered absolutely no justification for why there were deductions taken off the estimate (in fact, the emails from them indicated that they were willing to buy for higher than the estimate). \n\nMy experience with their trade-in wing is definitely indicative of their other services, because seriously?? They hire \"customer service specialists\" to lie about what their processes are so they can get your foot into the dealership? I certainly would not buy a car here. + I was there to have my '04 Santa Fe serviced for a recall and would like to give kudos to Connor, my service advisor, who kept me up to date on the happenings in my car, was able to check on another issue I was having and uncovered some significant concerns on my car. He brought me in to show me everything going on underneath my car and allowed me to make my own decisions on where to proceed. I knew things were starting to fail in my 11 yr old car, but this was able to solidify my need for a new vehicle......not that I wanted a car payment , but Connor definitely provided excellent customer service!!"

         "#1 Cochran Hyundai of South Hills",
         "Hi,\n\nThis is to detail my June of 2017 buying experience at Cochran South Hills Hyundai.  \n\nLet me start by saying the salesman, Gabe, was nice enough, or at least I thought so.  See my update below.  My issues with Cochran Hyundai of South Hills revolve around the deceptive nature of my car buying experience. Let me explain. My first contact with Cochran Hyundai was through their internet sales person. This fellow assured a certain price of a particular car. He even let me know once the sale was extended so that I could still receive the price we discussed and that Cochran had advertised. The price we discussed was prior to taxes, title, tags, etc. With my quote of 23,306 in hand I visited the dealer directly and test drive the car that has been discussed. When it comes time to purchase they pull out a price of 24,600. When I state that wasn't the price I was promised, they asked to see proof. I provided them the emails, plural, from their coworker. After some back room time - enough to make me wait and come up with a bogus excuse - the salesman informs me that the price I was given was the \"Memorial Day\" price. And of course Memorial Day had just passed. Of course the emails didn't state this anywhere, in fact they were darn clear on what the price was supposed to be, but Cochran South Hills had to come up with something, right? \n\nNow they knew I needed a car in a hurry because my family literally just had our first baby and my car had been totaled. Reluctantly, after sitting in silence with the salesman for a minute I said that I wanted to at least meet in the middle. This was after I said the Memorial Day price excuse was disingenuous and the salesman just looked at me. Of course they met in the middle at this point because they were squeezing $700 more out of me than they had agreed to. \n\nThe next issue I have was with the finiancing. My credit is over 800, so it's quite good. For the purposes of the sales process they quoted me 3.0%APR. After running my credit the salesman said \"Good news my friend, we're gonna be able to do better than that 3.0\". Great, right? Well when I sit down with Finance they gloss over the APR and I had to ask what rate I was receiving. Finance guy said 2.99%. I stared in disbelief as he just told me he only ran two credit checks out of three because my credit was so good. And, of course when the salesman said I'd do better than 3.0, I crazily believed he meant more than .01%. (This is after I asked what my rate would be after agreeing to purchase and the salesman said \"I don't really handle that\". Again, I needed the car and they knew it). After I protested saying my credit union could do better, they quickly got me approved though my credit union for 2.59%, a savings of about $300 over the 5 years. \n\nFinally, and not nearly as important in the grand scheme of things; the car was detailed poorly when I drove it off the lot. The glass was still hazy in the corners which is just plain annoying when you just spent 30k or so. Bottom line, Cochran did not honor their own \"Clearly Better Car Buying\" policy and it cost me about $700 plus interest. I will write to Cochran directly. I expect nothing more than a \"free\" oil change and\\/or checkup while they congratulate the sales team behind the scenes. The experience had made me cynical and has soured me on future Hyundai purchases (my family has purchased 6 thus far). If you're going to buy from these folks keep all your cards close to your vest and make them honor their pricing policies, otherwise be prepared to walk.\n\nUPDATE: It's been over 4 months and still no one from the dealership has spoken to me or emailed me.  No one from Cochran's corporate office either.  They're obviously hoping I forget.  \n\nAlso, up through model year 2017 Hyundai's Blue Link system is NOT FREE.  They give you the first 90 days free and then it's charged at whatever the prevailing rate is for this service.  At the dealership on the day I pick up my car, I foolishly BELIEVED the salesman, Gabe, when he asked for my credit card as part of the Blue Link trial sign up process.  He ASSURED me I wouldn't have to opt out of the process when the trial was up, that I would have to opt in before my credit card was charged.  Of course they CHARGED MY CARD $176 for this fee without asking.  I then had to call 3 times to have the bill removed.  SCAM.  From the LIE in the dealership about having to opt in and the hassle of canceling the sale after the fact, it's designed to sneak an additional charge onto you.  This is probably why it's now being included free with 2018 purchases because too many people probably threw fits over this service (and competitors offer similar stuff for free).\n\nI encourage you to not only do your homework but be prepared to be lied to and deceived.  If you like the old-school hassle of buying a car or not being spoken to once you're out the door, Cochran is the place for you.\n\nNext step is a letter to the PA Attorney General's office. + I leased my second Elantra from Cochran Hyundai of the South Hills today. My lease had two months to go and I went in to discuss options. I drove out with a brand new 2015 Elantra costing me less per month than the 2012 I turned in. I told them what I wanted, they found it and we closed the deal in less than a week. Bob Pacella was the salesman. Easy to work with. Gave me straightforward answers to my questions and found my car. + I was referred to #1 Cochran Hyundai of South Hills by a business associate in November 2010. \n\nI was looking to purchase a 2011 Hyundai Sonata Turbo SE. Upon arriving, I found that they had only one of these cars on the lot (they had just come out). The salesman told me that they had two more on the way, a white one, and a black one. I give a $500 deposit on the black one, and a week later my car arrived. \n\nAs someone who used to sell cars, let me tell you that #1 Cochran is an honest dealership. Everything is 100% above board, no surprises, no tricks. In my case. I was purchasing a brand new model, one of the first ones made. In fact, the salesman later confirmed that I owned just the 2nd car of this type in Pittsburgh. Due to the demand, I was told that they could offer me a $500 \"courtesy discount\" but that was it. However, they offered me a $2,000 trade in allowance on a car that, in all honesty,  was worth just $1,000. \n\nI am very pleased with the pricing and customer service offered by this dealership, and would be happy to recommend them to friends. + Sales Manager made the transaction quick and the loan process was smooth.  Not a tough sell and felt like it was a win-win purchase. + I found a car on #1 Cochran's website that I was interested in purchasing. I called and set up an appointment. I explained to the salesperson that I live nearly an hour and a half away from their location and that I would be taking a day off of work to come and purchase the vehicle. I was contacted by their sales team the morning of my appointment. They told me that the vehicle was ready and that my appointment time would be honored.\n\nI left my house with cash in hand and full intent to purchase the vehicle. After driving for nearly an hour and a half to arrive at #1 Cochran I received a phone call from their sales manager. He told me that the car was not available to be looked at and that I was errantly informed by whomever contacted me earlier that morning.\n\nI explained to the sales manager that, in addition to making a three hour round trip, I had taken the day off of work without pay to purchase the vehicle. My frustration was met with a half-hearted apology and a completely absurd explanation regarding an internal communication error.\n\nI realize large dealerships such as #1 Cochran can afford to lose a customer; if I don't buy the car, the next guy or gal will. That being said, a properly managed sales outfit deals with potentially negative customer interactions by preventing them before they occur. Of course mishaps and communication errors will indeed happen from time to time, however, there are proper and improper ways to handle such situations. #1 Cochran is a textbook example of the latter.\n\nI can understand a forgive a communication error. What I can not tolerate is a complete lack of respect for my time and my desire to become a #1 Cochran customer. + awesome service center. I had taken my minivan to a smaller mechanic who claimed he couldnt find anything wrong. called Cochran and they got me an appointment fast and found the issue. they did a thorough check and found my brakes needed to be relaced(which I had suspected). They called when they said they would and completed the work quickly and did a great job. Rates very reasonable. Will consider them my new service center. + Complete rip off. Never going here again. Every time they \"fix\" my car, it breaks down again. I've been towed to this location three times this month. They charge significantly more for labor than everyone else is town. Go somewhere else! + Okay service. I was sold a car that broke down right after I got it off the lot. They gave me a loaner until they could find me a new car. the new one cost more and they did not really work with me and I had already done the paperwork so I went with it. After purchase service was okay but considering they missed the issue with the first car I am unsure of just how good it was. Overall an Okay experience. Not great but not completely awful. + I have been getting my car serviced here for a while. From the moment you call to set up an appointment to the time you drive away it's been a truely  positive experience for me. This past weekend I was having some issues with my car and Victoria ( hope I got her name right) on the phone and also Mark at the service desk were very helpful. + I bought my car here in the fall and just took it in for the first oil change, which was free--a nice perk. Both the purchase and the service visits were good experiences. The people were friendly and knowledgable. The salesperson wanted me to be comfortable in my purchase and let me decide where to test drive it (I wanted to get some highway driving in). Plus, I love my Elantra! Would recommend #1 Cochran South Hills for purchasing and service."

         "#1 Cochran Kia - Robinson",
         "I called last week to make an appointment for my new Sorento's 1st oil change. They refused to make me an appointment and said I get \"quick service\" and to just show up and I would be cared for within 20 minutes. I came in on my day off at 10am and they then told me \"well it'll be about 40min.\" That's fine, I thought, at least they told me up front. It has now been an hour and my vehicle hasn't been touched yet. I asked for a manager and they said none were available. I explained that I tried to make an appointment to avoid this very issue and they said \"the quick service people called off.\" I strongly DO NOT recommend ever trying to take advantage of their so-called \"quick service\"!\n\nUpdated: They finished my car finally at an hour and a half and offered me a free oil change next time (first one was already free as the car was new). Changed review from 1 to 3 as I didn't ask for that, they offered it willingly. I appreciated the effort. + Great experience at the dealership last night, Brent Mangold got the job done for me again!   I wanted a Sedona and though my current lease wasn't up yet, he worked with me to get it done, he knew what was best for my family and made it happen.   It's always a pleasure working with Brent. + I leased my 2014 Kia Optima from this Kia location in January of 2014. I have since brought it there for service several times, and the staff has always been fantastic. Friendly, not pushing parts or service on me that was not needed, and always giving me discounts when available. Great Kia branch, I would definitely recommend it. + I purchased my Kia Soul from #1 Cochran back in 2012. Sales experience was pretty good. Everyone made me feel comfortable and listened to my needs. So if course I've been returning to the dealership for maintenance. Never left with an issue unresolved. But most recently my battery kept dying (this is my daughters car). I called and they \"squeezed\" me in on short notice. Diagnosed a bad battery and replaced it. Very thankful for their empathy and getting me in. I don't have to worry about my daughter driving home from work. \n\nThanks #1 Cochran! + Wonderful experience at Cochran Kia in Robinson.  They did a great job servicing my car and explaining everything that was done for me.  Thank you!!! + My salesman, Kirk, was very personable and helpful. He and his manager went above and beyond to help me get the car I've always wanted (a GREEN kia Soul). I would definitely recommend friends and family to go to them for their next vehicle purchase :) + Excellent service\\/concern about the customer and vehicle. Gotta be the best dealership I have ever bought a car from and returned for routine service, + General manager called me back and asked what he could do for me. He was very professional and took accountability. He told me he could and would refund the fee. I appreciated how quickly her responded and how he treated me with respect and as a valuable customer. \n\nThanks for handling my issue! + Not that you have a choice.  My Kia broke down under warranty, had it towed in on Monday at 8AM.  No loaner car.  They said they ordered the part and will have it back on Tuesday.  When I called them on Tuesday afternoon they said they ordered the wrong part and it would be Wednesday.  I said whatever, I'll rent a car, please change the oil and rotate the tires while it's there.  Called on Wednesday saying it was done, got there, they forgot to rotate the tires or change the oil.  Like pay attention. + I just purchased a new Kia at Cochran Kia in Robinson and I have to say these folks couldn't have been more professional, respectable and welcoming. Ron and Jason were exceptional and made the entire process easy. They were highly informed on the vehicles I was interested in,  patient and treated me as a valued customer. After the documents were signed, Ron spent an additional 30 minutes with me going over all the  technical and electronic options until I was comfortable. He even gave me his cell phone number and encouraged me to call him anytime with any questions! I couldn't be more satisfied with my new Kia and with my experience at this dealership.  They don't call them #1 for nothing. ....they earned it!\nTony Mollica"

         "#1 Cochran Mazda - Monroeville",
         "I went here with my son who was hunting for a certified used car. It was early evening when we arrived. This dealership is part of a megaplex of other makes and models all in the same complex.\n\nMy son had a reservation for a car he was interested in. They now have this type of computer that can give you a baseline for your trade and of course they will look at it to boot.\n\nHe asked for a test drive. The dealer showed us where to go for about a 5 minute spin. This is not my idea of a test drive but I know many dealerships do that. This car was a 2012 model with about 55,000 miles  which I thought would be a bit excessive for that year unless the previous owner did a lot of traveling.\n\nWe returned and wanted to barter with them over pricing but they just showed us the CARFAX report and comparables. Course the pressure tactics were on which I can't stand that we would get a slightly higher discount if he committed immediately.\n\n I had to ask about vehicle servicing. Even though that area would have been closed for the day it would have been nice to know where it was located. Please note I did learn that if you take your vehicle here for servicing they will only drive you within a 5 mile radius. Since the car he was looking at was certified pre owned he could take it to any Mazda dealership in the city.\n\nThere were a couple of other issues we pointed out about that car but they just showed us that some of their other cars have the same issues.\n\nThe complex sits on the downhill just after you pass the PA turnpike entrance between Monroeville and Murraysville. I know they will haggle us to buy just to make their commission but I felt we deserved better. Believe me, this is not one place I would look for a vehicle for myself and probably won't return. + I would rank this business as mediocre. Some visits are great, other visits are not so great. Have had the Mazda three we own serviced multiple times and it's not consistent. One time the car will be washed and vacuumed, another time not.  Also, tried to get a quote on leasing a new vehicle and seems that if ur not there in person, they could care less. Typical Cochran experience that I had in the past with Buick. Suppose We will find next nearest Mazda dealer and go there. Just depends who you are dealing with, what day of the week it is, and what direction the wind is blowing in. + Buying a new vehicle was a task that I was dreading. I left happy with the decision I made. It was just my luck that they had something in stock that worked for me. The sales staff was professional and let me have the time to think without any pressure ( I had initially come in for service on my old car). + Needed to get some mileage service done and an oil change. I recently moved to Pittsburgh from out of state so I needed to find somewhere to take care of my Mazda. I didn't even realize my inspection was up next month but they were able to do that for me while I was there too. I had made an appointment a few days before so it was really convenient, didn't take long at all, and Greg was friendly and helpful with my car. Great service and I'll definitely be going back."

         "#1 Cochran Mazda - North Hills",
         "My lease on my 2012 mazda 3 which I got at Billco mazda (now Cochran Mazda of north hills) is coming to an end this week.  A month and a half  ago my father and I went to Cochran mazda north hills on route 19 in wexford to \"start the talks\"  Ultimately i wanted to buy my 2012 mazda 3 out of its lease.  my initial visit, unfortunately, all we were able to do was basically say \"we will be back\" because the finance manager JJ Lavelle was not in that day and their other guy (cannot remember his name off the top of my head) was not in either.  Not a big deal but Chelsea Lavelle was the one that greeted my father and myself on our first visit.  super super friendly and personable human being.  She went out of her way to get some initial information out of us, in particular me because i needed to get out of my lease.  fast forward two weeks later, on Monday october 12th, I discover that JJ was working, I called my father and we came back.  JJ just like his sister Chelsea was just as personable, just as fantastic of a human being.  Between JJ and Chelsea they truly went out of their way to make my car buying experience so painless and actually enjoyable.  They both knew I was a bit stubborn because i am passionate with what i want and what i need especially out of a vehicle and leasing my 2012 mazda 3 skyactiv really set the bar high.  Pressure was on for Chelsea and JJ to help me out with my father as well for moral support especially because i have never actually done a full outright purchase of a vehicle by myself.  Of course, 9 times out of 10, you lease a car, when its up you trade it in. So after some discussion of what I wanted, what my expectations where, and so on, JJ tells Chelsea \"Go grab the Jet black 3\"  she rolls it on over and the fact that it had push button ignition on it scared me initially.  Chelsea very patiently made me feel so much at ease telling me all the security measures and that a push button ignition system is actually more secure than your standard metal key method.  So I took it for a test drive. I immediately fell in love with the new 2016 Mazda 3 that JJ and Chelsea recommended I take a look at.  Told JJ and my dad \"I want it! lets talk numbers!\"  After some back and forth, i got instantly approved for the loan, and the fact that with the purchase of my new 2016 mazda 3 at cochran mazda north hills, Free inspections, the GAP insurance (a glorified 72 month bumper to bumper warranty it seems) the fact that it was so new it never been test driven by no other customer than myself, I wasted no time, I wound up snatching the car up at a price i can afford, and a monthly payment and APR that i can live with.  If you are a Mazda guy, Cochran Mazda North Hills (10885 Perry Hwy Wexford PA 15090) is THE place to go buy your new Mazda.  Look for Chelsea and Gerald \"JJ\" Lavelle.  Chelsea on the sales rep end, JJ on the financing management end will go out of their way to make your car buying experience the best you will ever have!  Thank you JJ, Thank you Chelsea, and Thank you Rob Cochran for hiring grand slam employees at your Mazda dealership in Wexford.  (Side note: Thanks for giving me all weather floor mats for my car which originally did not come with the actual purchase of my new vehicle.  That right there is valuing your customers!) + Friendly and efficient service. When extra work pressed up against other commitments they juggled things to meet my needs. Been here many times with no complaints. Recommend strongly. + The staff at #1 Cochran Mazda were extremely helpful, friendly, respectful, and made the whole car buying process a breeze, with no pressure involved at all. The car that I originally wanted wasn't available, so Jamie B. went out of his way to make sure I got the car that I wanted. They all really went above and beyond. Great customer experience, and I will definitely go back to them! + Update 6\\/21: No check has been received. Mark Foster, the service director, noted in February that the check request had been made and that \"the check was approved and submitted but could take 30 - 45 days to receive\" (quoted from the voice mail message he left back then and which I will save for a small claims case, should I ever return to PA). One hundred days later, I'm still waiting for the check. Again, the issue is one of integrity and honesty, both of which #1 Cochran apparently lacks. \n\nUpdate 4\\/7: It has now been been slightly more than three weeks since Cochran Mazda has responded to my review (see below). As probably should come as little surprise, no refund has arrived, even though the Service Director finally did, for the first time, contact me soon after the review was posted. He stated that the refund had been submitted in February, and that it could take up to a month for it to arrive. If has not arrived, and it has now been three months since I first voiced my concerns & two months since the refund request is alleged to have been submitted. Moreover, I did not read in the response posted by Cochran Mazda, nor did I hear in the message from the Service Director, anything regarding the most important issue, i.e. how such a simple matter as headlight replacement could have gone wrong on two occasions in a two-week period. I'm not sure what the \"#1\" in \"#1 Cochran Mazda\" stands for, but it ain't service or honesty.\n\nIncompetent service and a dishonest Service Director: I took my Mazda to Cochran after my low beam headlight went out. The bulb was replaced, but when I drove the car after it was dark later that night, the beam for the replaced bulb was so badly aligned that its direct focus was on the middle stripe of the road--that is, straight down and to the left. I made an appointment to have it fixed soon thereafter; then, after a one-hour wait, the bulb was seemingly aligned properly. The following week, the other low beam headlight went out, so I took the car back to Cochran. Once again, the bulb was so badly aligned that, in fact, the poor illumination almost caused me to crash one rainy night a few days later. I took the car to another Mazda dealer, and the technicians fixed the problem. According to the alternate dealer, neither bulb had been seated properly, thus causing bad alignment and poor illumination. I contacted the Service Director at Cochran, who promised, in writing, to reimburse my expense after I sent him the invoice from the other Mazda dealer. I did so right away, but I did not hear back from anyone from Cochran, including Mark. I called Cochran, but the Service Director's phone took me straight to voice mail. I left a polite message asking that he call me back. I heard nothing back from him, so I re-sent the initial email to the Service Director, along with the invoice. I did not hear back from him. I contacted Cochran twice more, but I have still not heard back from the Service Director or Cochran. \n\nThis problem has now gone unresolved for approximately two months. I suspect that one reason that Cochran is behaving in such an unethical manner is that I have taken a temporary position out of the Pittsburgh area; however, the principle of honoring a promise is not one that should be predicated upon whether I am currently living in the area, If you make a promise, please follow through on the promise! \\/\\/ Folks, stay away from this place. I worry for anyone whose car needs service for more complicated and potentially dangerous mechanical issues, and I also worry for anyone who believes that this is an honest dealership.\n\n.................................................................................................................................................\nCochran C.\nCustomer Service\n3 weeks ago\nWe're sorry to hear of your issues. The Service Manager let us know that your check request was submitted and that he informed you that it would be sent directly to you. If you would like to speak to a member of our customer care team regarding this, feel free to email feedback@cochran.com + The salesperson defines the car buying experience and I was fortunate to work with Jamie Birsic after some not so pleasant salespeople in the past. He was completely attentive without being pushy and when it came to getting a price my wife and I could afford for the car we wanted, he made it happen. I have already recommended him to several friends and neighbors for their next car purchase. + I took my car in to get a inside passenger side panel replaced.  After waiting for an hour they came back and said the part wasn't in.  I called before I made the appointment to make sure the panel was there.  Ordered the part again.  I will tell you the end of the story.  My new part came in Friday, I went to pick it up and asked if it was the right part.  Mike said lets go out and see, he tried to put it on and it didn't fit, wrong part.  To make a long story short they had the right part the first time only they tried to put it on the wrong side of the console.  It was obvious that there was nothing wrong with the drivers side panel the passenger side was laying on the floor.  All taken care of now, went back in and got the right panel. + I bought my first new car here a few months ago ( 2016 CX-5). It was a great experience. Chelsea was my sales associate and she was wonderful. She was very nice and helpful, and the process with her was very relaxed- it was nice to actually ENJOY the experience of buying a new car (as it should be)! She was extremely knowledgeable and helped me to find a vehicle with features based on what I wanted. JJ was my finance manager who processed the sale- and again, he was extremely helpful and fun. It was apparent that he had a lot of experience and was very trustworthy. I still recommend visiting Chelsea & JJ at Cochran Mazda to my friends. After my experience with them, I would never go and see anyone else! I absolutely am still in love with my CX-5, and still get compliments on it from all of my friends who ride in it. + Best car buying experience I've ever had.  Extremely friendly team, from sales to financing.  Definitely enjoyed not having the horrible feeling of haggling for a fair price. They leave the standard car dealer gimmicks out and focus on providing great customer service from start to finish, not to mention selling some of the best cars available.  I'd recommend this dealership to anyone.  Thanks doing such a great job! + Unless you want emails for life, don't bother.  While I had an ok experience with car purchasing, other things were not so smooth.  First, they assumed what name I wanted the car in without asking.  I wanted it in two peoples names.  They pre filled out the paperwork and were closing so I couldn't change it.  When they asked for my email I said I didn't want to give it because I hate unsolicited emails.  They assured me it was only to fill out a satisfaction survey for the salesman.  I have gotten numerous emails from this place despite calling, talking to managers, etc. over the past 2.5 years. They are basically harassing me through email.  And you can't unsubscribe or block.  I've bought three cars since my purchase from them and will never buy another from them because the fact that they won't stop emailing me is so annoying!!! + Chelsea was great! I love my Mazda CX-5.  Everyone there were very helpful. Will definitely go back in the future and recommend it to anyone!"

         "#1 Cochran Monroeville Collision Center",
         "This collision center has made me never ever want to buy another car from Cochran again! I was in a accident in early December, I did not receive the quote until mid to late January. I then didn't receive the fixed car until March. When I received the car back the trim was all wrong the heater did not work and one headlight did not work and today I found out the windshield wiper fluid container leaks. To top it off no one would return my phone calls and they were completely unprofessional. I will never recommend Cochran to anyone because of this experience. I have had to shell out money from my own pockets to fix their mistakes because I am exhausted from trying to get my car fixed. + I just moved here and made a boo boo on my car for the first time  AAA recommended here because I was just going to use my insurance. It took about a week and a half to get it fixed. The workers were all friendly. Daniel Roberts was the collision center advisor and he kept me posted on my car status. Got my rental their because Enterprise had a station there so that was nice and convenient. + This is the worst place to take your car to! I cannot emphasize enough how awful their service is. We had a collision with a deer and it took them a month and a half to fix our car. They promised us that it would be done two weeks before they actually finished it and even then when I came to pick it up it was still full of glass and had to be taken back to be vacuumed out TWICE! And our car is still full of glass! The customer service is beyond awful, they are next to impossible to get ahold of, consistently gave incorrect information, and in general seemed to have no clue what was going on with our car. I will never go back to this completely incompetent body shop! + My only regret with this review is that I didn't think to post it earlier.\n\nIn early 2012, I graduated college and was moving to the Greater Pittsburgh area for my first \"big girl job\".  The day I moved, I hit black ice and wrecked my 2007 Subaru Impreza into a ditch.  It sustained extensive front end damage and AAA recommended I take my vehicle to Cochran Collision Center.\n\nIt took over a week for them to make the repairs to the vehicle.  Despite having an appointment to pick my Subaru up, I waited over an hour in the waiting room.  When someone finally came to show me to my car the front end looked great. However, now it also had back end damage. \n\nIt was very evident by the white paint scrapes and a large dent, that someone had hit the rear driver's side bumper.  The gentleman that escorted me to my vehicle insisted it was there when it was delivered to Cochran.  He continued to insult me saying it was my fault, since I only gave them permission to fix the front end damage.   He then began pressuring me to come inside and sign the paperwork.  I was never in an accident with another vehicle.  He was clearly insulting my intelligence.\n\nIn the end, I requested they take a look at the pictures they took when my vehicle was dropped off.  He eventually came back and informed me I was indeed correct and the damage had occurred while my car was on their lot.\n\nAfter almost another week, they fixed my car for the second time.  On their bill.\n\nFast forward to why I decided to write this review now.  My car was again, hit while parked in a parking lot.  So, I took the car to be repaired.  The damage was on that same rear driver's side bumper.  The body shop repairman not only immediately noticed it had previously been repaired but commented that it was \"some of the worst bodywork he'd ever seen.\"  He explained that it had never been repaired to the correct standards.\n\nI still to this day feel that Cochran Collision was taking advantage of me.  If I would have agreed to sign the paperwork and had left their lot, they never would have been held accountable.  Looking back the way they treated me still angers me.  \n\nI don't trust them and I truly hope you won't either.\n\nUpdate: I think the more insulting thing is they basically mocked me in messages after writing this post. Sorry Cochran, but you're terrible business people and can't ever \"make things right\". + I wish I hadn't had to visit this auto repair\\/body shop but, alas, I've finally become a true Pennsylvanian by hitting my first deer with my car.  I'm ok and the car really suffered the least amount of damage possible considering the speed with which I struck the deer.  The deer --- not as fortunate, sadly.\n\nMy insurance company, State Farm, has a relationship with this auto repair\\/body shop in which they each work it out with one another on the repair estimate and billing plus it's very convenient to where I live so I opted to take my car here for the required repairs.\n\nI am very pleased.\n1)  Rob was my contact person and was very informative on about how many days it would take, the estimate, and getting me the appointment when parts came in.\n2)  The final bill was pretty close to the initial estimate -- a few other minor things were found to be needed.\n3)  The time away from my car was pretty close to the initial estimate -- parts came in later than expected throwing the time off by a day.\n4)  The entire staff was very pleasant to work with.\n5)  Efficiency, Efficiency, Efficiency! -- paperwork for me to sign was as minimal as you can get, time necessary to drop the car off and pick it up was the least amount of time you can expect.\n6) Oh, and efficiency?  Enterprise car rental is on-site and, again, has a relationship with my insurance company, Sate Farm, so, again, in and out in a flash with very minimal paperwork in the end.  John was my contact person and was very helpful.  I'm reviewing the Enterprise transaction here because it looks as if Enterprise does not list this as a general Enterprise rental place.  Perhaps then it is only available to clients of Cochran Collision center.  My only beef:  the selection of autos available to rent were high-end and big models.  I was given a choice of 3 vehicles -- a Cadillac big car, and Audi big car, and a Buick big car.  They said they had a Ford Focus but it needed maintenance.  I selected the big Cadillac and it was a nice car with only 250 miles logged on it before I added my own.  But, it's not my car of choice for model or size and would not fit in my garage.  My real beef about this is that is would certainly have the appearance that Enterprise stocks the line of cars it does because, after all, most people at a collision shop have insurance.  You see where I'm going with this.  Not nice.  Ya need some compact cars, Enterprise....geez.\n\nI would say I'll be back but I really hope not to have a need, all things considered! + I have had body work done on my car here several times.  The employees at the desk and the repair personnel are very friendly and pleasant in person, and so far I have no complaints about the work itself.  They also did a nice job of cleaning the car up for me afterwards.\n\nHowever, the customer service on the phone is appalling and the scheduling is a nightmare.  I had to call several times to get scheduled to actually have the work done.  I would always be redirected from person to person before finally leaving a message asking to be called back, never to receive a call.  Eventually I had to get short with the receptionist, which I hate to do, and complain about the service.  They then scheduled me for a couple days later.  I am convinced that was the only way I was ever going get scheduled.  \n\nThe first few times I used Cochran were not as bad but it was still a hassle.\n\nSadly, I found the latest experience so drawn out and stressful that I would be very reluctant to use them again."

         "This is the only place in go to get my car work on and sales Alan Etkins and Joe Cerimeli are amazing I have brought 3 cars from Alan and will never go anywhere eles if you want a honest man and a good place go there. Go there and ask for Alan + In the last 14 years we have leased 4 cars and purchased 2 from #1 Cochran Nissan.  We picked up our newest car just a few days ago.  Overall we are happy with the buying experience and process.  All 6 times we have dealt with the same salesperson - Alan Etkins. He is truly excellent at his work.  He is patient, knowledgeable and very accommodating.   We are loyal customers of this dealership because of Alan.  \n\nI have a small matter to address with Nissan and will be reaching out to the company directly. + Avoid #1 Cochran Nissan at all costs!!!\n\nBryan had been looking for a car and figured out that he wanted a Nissan Maxima. After being ignored for 40 minutes when he was there (unheard at ANY dealership), he still went back, since they had the car he wanted in stock. He gave their internet guy and sales manager a chance. Though neither of them actually met with him when they were supposed to, the sales guy seemed okay... Until he decided to buy the car the next day (Friday at noon). They said they'd get back to him with rates, but though he called MULTIPLE TIMES and emailed, they didn't give him the (INSANELY HIGH) rates, which were clearly designed to screw him (he has good credit and can easily get a good rate for a new car) in hopes that he'd want the car so badly he'd go with their crappy rates, since the bank was closed, until he got there that night to pick up the car.\n\nThey lied repeatedly \"We're losing money on this car.\" PLEASE. I worked at a car dealership and even if I hadn't EVERYONE with half a brain knows THAT never happens. Are they selling it for less than they'd planned, since it's not a 2016? Possible. But car dealerships don't sell for under cost any more than casinos lose money on their guests. I've never bought a used car, but these guys reminded me of the stereotypical sleazy used car salesmen & finance guys. There are PLENTY of other dealers in the area. If you want a Nissan, go somewhere else.\n\nI see no way to respond to the response, so I'm editing my review.\n\nWe dealt with this dealership FOUR SEPARATE days and it is DEFINITELY how they did business 100% of that time. There is NO WAY we could have caught EVERYONE in the dealership on a bad day 4\\/5 days of the week if it were NOT the way they normally did business. It is very clear that they are horrible most (if not all) the time.\n\nTo make matters worse, the GM (who didn't impress us in person) called Bryan today to try to give him pathetic excuses. It turns out that they could have gotten Bryan a MUCH better deal (even better than the better deal he'd seen on PNC himself), but the finance manager was either too stupid or too lazy to get that deal. He clearly didn't even try. \n\nI will NEVER step foot on another #1 Cochran lot of ANY kind, since it is clear they are okay with these horrible (and possibly illegal - I don't know PA's law on it, but if telling someone you got them the lowest rate and presenting them a rate more than 1% higher isn't illegal, it SHOULD BE) processes. STAY AWAY! Do not be fooled by the pretense of the caring comment. + No complaints here, both myself and my husband are on our second lease with chochran Nissan. Good service when we need it  , Sam in the service dept always takes good care of us . + I could not have left this dealer any happier and that all started with me working with Alan Etkins. I have now been through 2 new cars with him, a NIssan Rogue and an Altima. He helped me understand the type of car I wanted, by starting off with considering what I needed from a cost and options standpoint in the car. He made me feel like I was top priority while I was at the dealer. I am so happy that I went with Cochran and I am so fortunate that I was working with Alan Etkins!\n\nI have never had a poor experience here, whether it was dealing with the service area, or on the floor with any of the salesman. I highly recommend this dealer to anyone who is looking to talk about options for buying a car. They will help you understand the options and help you find your next car. + I was at Cochran Nissan this morning for a vehicle inspection.  My Service Advisor was Joshua D'loss.  He did not pass my Pathfinder due to the tire tread on the front two tires.  When I got home, my tires were inspected and there is still plenty of tread. The tread is not anywhere near the tread indicator and looks like there's still at least 7000 miles left on my tires.  The timing seems to be very suspicious because apparently there are some tires on special, buy three get one for $1.  How convenient that I would need new tires while there's a special.  My vehicle was brought somewhere else for inspection and it passed.  What terrible service I received today!  I'll never go back there for ANY service! + Great service and excellent feedback from service reps. I suspected a problem on my vehicle a and not only did they confirm the problem I suspected they also incpected the rest of the vehicle and alerted me of a few additional minor problems before they fixed them so I had the choice to pay for those repairs or handle myself. I couldn't ask for a better approach. Glad they are my local Nissan dealer. + I love love love my new 2016 Nissan Rogue SV!  I knew I wanted a SUV but I wasn't sure which make I wanted.  Justin Taylor helped me out so much by looking at different makes of SUVs.  He was searching for the best deal for me and found it.  I'm so happy with choosing Cochran! + I signed a loan to get a beautiful 2012 Dodge Charger for my 19 yr old son. Almost 6 mos to the day the exhaust needed work. Doug Ward, Manager, was professional and handled our situation with ease. Took the car in right away and his staff did an awesome job repairing it. More beautiful than when we bought it. Did I mention...\"no charge\"!!! Worry free...Rob Cochran has this stuff down with customers! Would definitely return for another vehicle in the future! It truly was a blessing...You should definitely check this place out!! + I think my experiences trying to get a car from Cochran might be a textbook example of what NOT to do to get a customer! Allow me to explain.\n   On Monday, 10\\/26, my sons vehicle gave up the ghost. After talking it over, he decided to lease a new vehicle to replace it. A simple and straightforward transaction, no trade, just find a car and lease it for 3 years. He asked for my help since i have done this a lot over the years.\n   After doing some research, we decided on a Sentra. Cochran was running a lease deal, we found it on their website. A sentra 3 year lease for $50\\/down and $160\\/mo. The price was where he wanted to be, and he liked the car. Good. Now, all we needed to determine was which cars in stock qualified for that lease payment, then pick one and go pick it up on Saturday.\n    Well, at least that was the plan. My first point of contact was on Tuesday, i used the form on their website to make my inquiry. After receiving no response, i called late Wednesday morning. I ended up talking to a salesperson named Lisa, who apologized for the lack of response. I explained what we were doing, and asked her to email me copoes of the window stickers of the cars that qualified for the lease so we could pick one. She promised to do so promptly.\n    By the end of my workday, i still had not received the info, so i called again on my way home. I was told Lisa was not in, and i talked to Michael.I asked him to send me the information. He sent me an email with a link to their inventory. AT that point, i decided to ask my question a little differently. I picked 3 stock numbers, asked for the window sticker, and asked if these cars qualified for the lease price. I sent the email that evening(Wednesday)\n   Thursday morning i got my response. No window sticker. *sigh*. This was beginning to get a bit aggravating. What i found a bit disturbing was what he wrote in regard to the lease price. This is what he said\n   \" I am not in finance and cannot provide you with payment information. Finalization of payments has to be done in the showroom. Even if I were able to get you a lease quote it would be subject to, and more than likely will change when you arrive in the showroom.\n\n \n\nAs we discussed on the phone yesterday, lease prices are not black and white. These lease deals come down to us from the manufacturer, and while they can serve as a good base point, they will always be subject to change\"\n \n   I found that a little disturbing. Why offer something on your website that isn't real? Will most likely change? Huh???\n   I decided to give Cochran one more chance. I wrote back and reminded him that the lease deal was in black and white right on THEIR website(not Nissans), and would he please send me the information i asked for.\n   That afternoon,(this was Thursday), he answered my email by telling me i needed to come into the showroom.\n \n    At that point i was pretty fed up. I picked up the phone, called a competitor, and within one hour i had all the information i asked for, and had a car selected and the deal made My son filled out the online credit ap and was approved 45 minutes later.. We picked up the new car last Saturday(10\\/31)\\/ It was actually a better model of the Sentra for the same payment as Cochran. \n \n   This sale was Cochrans to lose and they lost it. Time to post a good review of the competitor that we did lease the car from."

         "I was happy to buy my Foster here. They have me the best deal that I had found. I didn't have to stand around long to talk to a salesperson. The service however, that's lacking. My first few visits were decent, but my last visit was not. I paid almost 100 bucks for my oil change, tire rotation, etc. I asked prior if that would include the multi point inspection, but yea, they didn't do it. I tried to call, email... no response... ever. I made sure to give them an appropriate Subaru survey for the experience. I left them for a bigger disappointment (Day West Liberty Subaru)... to only return to a great, trustworthy and local (non-dealer) mechanic shop, Cher-Ban tire. + I purchased my first Subaru here in 2009.  I enjoyed working with one of their sales consultants (who happens to be female) on the test drive and sale.  I didn't get a good vibe from her boss, but I was very glad to be helped by her, especially since the purchase came at a difficult time for me.  The dealership was very accommodating and even let me borrow one of the cars overnight!  At the last minute, I decided to buy a different model, and received a nice discount since it was the last one and a manual transmission.  Side note: their waiting area in the service department is excellent. + BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!  We were very leery because they are such a large dealership, but Shelly had us in a Subaru CrossTrek for a test drive at 9:07 and driving away with it by 12:09.  She was so nice, professional, and could answer with ease every question we asked. + Charlie and the crew in the service department are the best! I bought my Subaru at #1 Cochran and have it serviced there too! I had a brake light switch problem, they were very busy the day I was there, Cochran picked up the tab because they had been seeing this issue enough and because they made me wait longer than they initially said! Unbelievable customer service!! + So while my husband and I had an experience that was a complete misunderstanding, our rating has to be 5 star based upon Charlie's response to the situation.  There was a confusion regarding both sides and it is only fair to address this as Charlie addressed the situation promptly and more than fair.  I have to say that my trust in this business has been regained and a greater understanding was communicated.  I have to say it was enlightening that we didn't have to argue or further explain ourselves.  It is individuals like Charlie that make up for the bad experiences out there. + Worst buying experience ever. We were here today, the sales man was very rude. We bought a 2014 Subaru outback last year and want to get another Subaru for my husband this year. He wanted to test drive the outback, legacy and forester to compare which one he likes the most. The sales man was very cold and made us feel so uncomfortable. He gave us  a feeling that he doesn't want to explain to us about the car. There was rarely any conversation during the test drive. Also, he was texting during our test drive!!! So unprofessional!!! The last and the most thing pissing me off was at the end, when we didn't make the deal work, he THREW his card at us. Yes, very rude. We will never come back for this dealer. + When I actually had my car serviced here, they did a decent job. The problem, however, is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of their service center or to schedule an appointment within 3-4 weeks. I called approximately 10 times over a 2 week span, and never once talked to an actual person. I was immediately put on hold and would stay there for 5-10 minutes before I eventually would hang up. There is no option to speak to a person, you just simply get put on immediate hold. I started to wonder if they were even open for business anymore. I even tried calling the operator for the entire Cochran center, and was also placed on indefinite hold. This is unacceptable service. When I FINALLY got in touch with someone 2 weeks later, they had no open appointments for the next 3 weeks. I eventually decided to use another local Subaru dealership where my business was valued and appreciated. Day West Subaru is a much better option in this regard.\n\nI can also speak to their sales staff. When I was looking to buy a new car last year, I went to their show room before anywhere else because it was the closest subaru dealership. I stood around for 20-30 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence. At that point I was just staying to see how long it would actually take someone to speak to me. Even a front desk clerk to tell me that someone would be with me shortly would've been enough to keep my business, but instead people would deliberately not look at me as they walked by. Again, I ended up taking my business to another Subaru dealership I have purchased from previously that values my business. In this regard I would highly recommend Spangler Subaru in Johnstown if you can manage the drive. I have purchased two new vehicles from them and they are spectacular\nIn summary, this is the worst dealership I have had the displeasure of working with. + Haven't purchased here yet, but have taken my Subaru in several times and had great experiences with them, a few months  ago, took our 2011 Honda CR-V in to trade in, unfortunately we have only had it about a year and still owe way to much on it, the sales man we worked with was amazing though he took us on a great test drive of the new Subaru Legacies, The sells man showed us everything we asked to see and even took us on an almost hour long test drive to show us every feature, granted I already own a Subaru, so some of it was not necessary, but the new things where very nice to see, now after all of that we got back to the show room, and by this point it was very close to closing time, and after running numbers and finding out the car would cost almost double we are paying for the old car, damn negative equity, he was super nice and willfully all the way and even when we said no, and thank you for his time he was super great about it and not in a way that made us feel like we wasted his time. Which many places do.  I honestly can not em ever his name, but be had. A nickname of honest joe I think, gray guy, and we totally plan on buying someday, just not as soon as we had hopped. + wish I had bought my car here. Bought a 2015  Forester at I 79 Honda in Mount Morris  and with in 2 weeks severe tire wear in the back. To make a long story short they refused to fix it. I work in Monroeville  near the Subaru dealership and took it there for the tires and to look at it. within 5 minutes they found the problem - it was a very bent sway bar. They not only replaced the tires but spoke to Subaru and got it covered. Greg, our customer service guy ordered the part and called me when it came in a day later. They have a courtesy van (within 5 miles I think)so I came up at 8am, they drove me to work, called when it was finished, I called the van to let them know when I wanted to be picked up. The van arrived right on time, car was done and the difference in how it drives is amazing. Even though I didn't buy it there they did everything they could to make it right  - you can be sure my next car will be coming from there! Thank you Greg for all your help. + I brought my 2011 Legacy to a different dealership for extensive body work after an accident. A few months later it became evident the work performed by the other dealership was extremely problematic, so I made an appointment with Larry at Subaru Service to diagnose the issues with my car. It took several weeks for insurance adjusters to perform their evaluation and ultimately total the car, but Larry made the process easy and painless by calling me with frequent updates and setting me up with a loaner car. I really felt like he was on my side. Once my car was officially totaled, Larry sent me to Anna in sales. She quickly scheduled an appointment for me to take some test drives. I had a lot of questions about specs and trims, and Anna always gave me a clear and detailed answer. This is the fourth Subaru my family has purchased with Anna, and we will continue to do so! Thank you Larry and Anna for the excellent customer service and experience!"

         "AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COSTS.  Last Tuesday I brought my 2014 Beetle in for routine maintenance and a rattling sound during acceleration.  When I brought it in, the service advisor seemed dismissive but I didn't think much of it and I was told that I'd get a call the next day.  I asked if they had a loaner car I could use in the meantime and was told no -- fine, I just took the shuttle.  I waited for a call Wednesday and as the service department closes at 6, I was getting a little concerned when they hadn't called me by 4:30 so I called them and was directed though the automated phone system and central service department only to be sent to the service manager's voicemail.  When he did call back, he told me they still haven't diagnosed the car and would need to do an engine teardown as they thought the timing chain was causing the noise -- a $400 proposition.  They went ahead with this as they said if it was the timing chain, it would be covered under the factory warranty and that it would be unsafe to drive the car in this condition.  I heard nothing for 2 more days until Friday they called to tell me that the timing chain is fine and they still don't know what's wrong and that they'll have to contact the VW service hotline to continue the diagnosis. At this point I've been without a car for the better part of a week as I still had not been offered a loaner. Two more days go by and after hearing nothing from the service department I called again Monday afternoon and spoke to the service manager who told me that they haven't yet submitted a request to the service hotline as the shop foreman needed more information which I was told couldn't be collected until the next day as other cars had been sitting around longer than mine, which is concerning. I remarked about how much of an inconvenience this has been and told him that they should consider getting loaner cars in the future.  In response, he told me that they had them but they were all TDIs and had ben recalled by VW -- seems like a questionable excuse ad that happened a year ago, could you not get new ones?? -- but whatever.  The next day, I called in the morning to ask if they had put in the request as I was a bit miffed that it had taken this long to do considering they had determined that they'd need to put in this request on Friday. I was told that they would be putting it in and that I'd hear back soon. After not hearing anything for the rest of the day, I called again around 4:30 and was told that they had determined the sound was caused by a few loose bolts in the torque converter -- of course not covered by the factory warranty -- and that they'll tighten them and that they'll have a shuttle driver contact me so I can come pick up the car.  Hours later at 6:30, I get another call from the service manager saying that the shuttle won't be able to come get me until the morning -- you know, when I'd be at work.  As that wouldn't work for my schedule I got a ride to the dealership to pick up the car.  I was handed a $816 service bill -- mind you I have been out of a car for a week at this point and have been treated to the some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  However, since the service department was closed and the only way to get my car back was to pay the bill, I did.  But when I finally got in the car to leave I noticed that my radio won't work -- it had been working perfectly right up to when I dropped the car of last week.  I went back in to let the person who released the keys to me know and was -- guess what -- offered a loaner car.  You know, the ones they told me earlier they didn't have.  I asked about that and was assured that they have them and that I could definitely have one because of my radio.  What??  Why not offer that when I had been out of a car for a week or when I asked multiple times?  I just decided to take my car and will be contacting the manager to see what they can do to fix this mess.  Overall a horrible, frustrating experience.  Take this internet stranger's advice and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nEDIT: I was refunded the cost of labor for the timing chain replacement as it turns out they never actually did it.  I appreciate the honesty in doing that refund but when I brought up my radio issue I was essentially told too bad and that they didn't touch it so it must have been broken when I brought it in which was not the case at all. + Such an easy drop off procedure. I was able to drop my car and leave the keys securely early int he morning as to not interrupt my work day. The car was ready and waiting for me at the end of the day. \n\nThis team is always professional and accommodating. + I had a great experience leasing my first Volkswagen. I've only ever purchased\\/leased cars from Cochran and will continue due to great pricing, polite and fun sales teams and patience through the process. I took time to make my decision and they never once made me feel like I needed to rush. They asked about any reservations and addressed them. I felt like I was working with real people who are consumers themselves, not just sales people. + I needed just routine maintenance and a state inspection and brought my VW to this dealership. The car is a 2002 so I always get nervous when bringing it in for service because  afraid I'll be told I need some\nbig repairs. \n\nThis time they didn't find anything. It was nice to just have to pay for the oil change and inspection. \n\nI had an appointment which I made over the phone. The person taking he appointment was polite. \n\nI brought it in at 8:00 and was promised the car back by 2:00. I was called around noon and told it was ready. \n\nOverall it was a nice experience. They did not seem too busy either. + I went to Cochran in South Hills for my Jetta's yearly oil change and service checkup. The service representative was friendly and helpful. He took time to explain everything that had been done and exactly how my breaks and tires were doing. The waiting room was comfortable and even included coffee and snacks. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the appointment took longer than expected. Again, though, mostly a positive experience. + After moving here from out of state I needed a place to continue service on my VW. I had been taking it to a VW dealership in the state that I moved from since I purchase the car 5 years ago. The service I had experienced was ALWAYS excellent - like I mattered and my business was important. \n\nI chose Cochran VW because they were the closest to my house and made an assumption that all VE dealerships and their service departments were all required to treat their customers well. Not the case!  I had a basic service performed around February with no issues reported. When my car lost significant power (not completely) while driving on a Wednesday night at the end of April, I had it towed to Cochran during the night. The next morning I called to check in and explain what had happened. I talked with Mike. He told me they would have a look and call me back with their findings. I hadn't heard back by 4 so I called Mike. He didn't answer so I left a voicemail. He called me back at 4:20 and I missed it but called him back immediately. I had to leave another message. I waited a couple minutes and called back again. Mike told me that I needed a new battery and that nothing else could be checked until it had a new battery. I thought the price was really high and told him that. He said I could take my car elsewhere (which I'm sure he knew would mean another tow). I told him I would call him back. He said he would only be there for 15-20 mins. I called him back in under 10. He didn't pick up or return my call. I called back Thursday morning and told him to go ahead with replacing the battery so we could find out what was wrong with my car. He called back at 10:30 to tell me my battery was replaced and nothing else was wrong with it. I could pick it up.   On the way home, the engine light and the EPC light came on. I parked in my garage and called Mike and left him a message. He didn't call back. I tried calling Justin, the service Director, but his voicemail was full. I called Mike 2 more times. No answer. I sent an email to Justin. By Friday afternoon I had not heard back from either. I called the main line and she put me through to Justin. I talked to him for 5 minutes where I continued to feel as though he wasn't really listening - like he was just saying uh huh over and over. It was infuriating. He told me I could have it towed back, at my expense, and have them look at it again. I hung up. I took it elsewhere and they quickly diagnosed the problem, replaced the part and were great!!  I will NEVER recommend these guys, I will not buy my new car from them and I will repeat this story every chance I get. + Sent my Jetta in for Auto Butler treatment and PA inspection. It came back lobotomized. They changed the software. I'm heart broken. My Jetta will never be the same. + Recently visited Cochran VW of South Hills for the first time due to needing a front-end alignment on my 2010 Jetta Sportwagen. The staff were extremely knowledgeable, very courteous and the waiting area was comfortable as well. Being a loyal VW customer (this is my 5th!!) I would highly recommend these guys! :) + Why wont they let me speak to the people working on my car. Everyone else looks at me like I am bothering them. Seventy five dollars for an oil change, seventy -two dollars for tire rotation ,and it took over two hours TWO HOURS ,I DID MAKE AN APPOINTMENT--- TOTAL PRICE OVER -----------150.00 bucks -------\nLooking at the photos that are posted if you notice there are no customers + Won't buy back my car because of the diesel issue with VW.  Won't even talk about it, sales manager hasn't returned my voicemail.\n\nI would say that they are in a tough spot from VW but Cochran needs to take some ownership in this issue as they are the conduit between auto manufacturer and buyers.\n\nOverall I would say don't use this place they seem to have some good employees but quite a few overly arrogant employees."

         "I should start out by saying that my girlfriend and I come here almost every Wednesday Night for their trivia.  We originally found out about the trivia through a flyer on their wall while picking up a six pack.  My girlfriend and I had such a good time that we keep on going, more often than not with some friends or family now.\n\nThe store itself is probably not how you would picture a place that has a bar and food.  It is dominated by the coolers and shelves full of beer like most 6 pack shops on one side and then there is a bar with some tables on the other side.  The tables are quite cool as they are completely covered by different beer labels that you probably have not seen before.  As this is a beer store, the coolers and shelves of beer are where they shine.  They advertise to have more than 800 different types of beer and are constantly getting new ones.  They also have a rotating selection of about 10 different beers on tap which they allow you to try before buying.  What I really enjoy is that you can grab a bottle of beer out of the cooler and sit down and drink it and it is actually reasonably priced.\n\nSo with all of that being said I generally do not eat here too often but my girlfriend and I decided to eat here this past Wednesday.  They have a limited menu of some bar food due to their set up but I believe they might be looking to expand on that in the future and I hope that they do.  The food that I had at their Christmas party this past year was wonderful and I hope to have more of it in the future.  For dinner I decided on having the Frankfurt hotdog which is a hotdog with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard and also the Chicken Nachos with cheese and chili.  The hot dog was large and of good quality as far as hot dogs go and I enjoyed it for what it was.  My chicken nachos were also good although I found the chicken a bit dry.  Overall I was satisfied with my meal but that is not the real reason that I come here frequently.  That reason is their great selection of beer and good customer service.  The owners are really nice people and will get to you know you fairly quickly once you start going in.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be coming back here in the near future.  The food itself I would have only rated as 3 stars but the friendliness of the staff, great beer selection and promotions helps to bump them up to 5 stars for me. + I really like this place. Beer and hot dogs, how can you go wrong? The name kind of throws you off though. My boyfriend laughed at me when I said I wanted to try it, he said it was a dog groomers. It's a little pricey, but anywhere you buy a single beer is. But the hotdogs are good, and the owners are very nice. It's a cute little place to grab some lunch. + They are closing......the owner said they are going to relocate to the Southside.  It was a good place while it lasted. + Huge Selection of hard to find beers and not so hard to find beers. I tried one of the hot dogs, a \"Burgh Dog,\" which was very tasty treat sort of like a chillidog with melted cheese whiz on it. They are kind enough to allow the local homebrew club to have a monthly meeting here now and again and I really respect that. Come on over and check out to see if there is anything you have never had and might enjoy. + Great to have a place like this in Wexford. However, I just paid $19 to fill a growler that was discounted....not cheap (that's about $3.50 a beer, way above what it should be for a growler fill up). Great selection, friendly staff, one of my favorites."

         "1-800-GOT-JUNK? Pittsburgh City",
         "1800 Got Junk is great I used them in Maryland and now I'm Pittsburgh. Service is always consistent friendly on time efficient and never over charge. Their culture is a lot like McDonald's .You no exactly what your going to get. You pay a little extra for their service but you don't have to deal with Larry and his brother Larry garbage hauling and all the grief that can probably occur I recommend Got Junk 100% + I just had a really positive experience with 1-800 got junk.\n\nCalled today around noon and was able to schedule an appointment for later that day.  They arrived exactly when they said they would, they quoted me a price that I thought was reasonable, they hauled my junk away, and the transaction was all done in about 20 minutes. I couldn't ask for more. Great service, great experience. + I have to say, I was skeptical of 1800 junk and all of its five star reviews.  But we had an old tube tv that weighed about 300 lbs (three adults working together couldn't move it!), and there was no commitment to book an appointment online so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I booked an appointment for between 8 and 10 am Monday morning on only two days notice, two guys showed up at our place around 8:10.  We payed just over $200 to have three TVs (one huge tube TV and two smaller TVs) and a TV stand removed.  Not cheap, but there don't seem to be many alternatives given PA's laws on electronics recycling.  The employees were polite and efficient.  Highly recommend. + 1-800-GOT-JUNK came to our house to remove an armoire from an upstairs bedroom. It was a large piece of furniture, so we suggested that they take it out in two pieces to make it lighter and easier to maneuver. They did, but then proceeded to drag it across our hardwood floors, scratching huge, deep gouges in the wood. We pointed that out, and after a lot of arguing and resistance that went on for months, they finally agreed to pay to repair the floors--with the exception of $1000, which we had to contribute to the repairs. And they still charged us more than $300 to move the piece of furniture. Unscrupulous business. Very unprofessional. I recommend you look elsewhere. + I was very pleased with the service.  \n\nI had several large, very heavy appliances in my basement that I was unable to move, and the only way to get them out was through a tight stairway with a 90 degree bend in it.  The guys were able to get everything up and out, in a timely and professional manner.  They were very courteous, professional, and I was pleased with the amount that I paid for the service -- I actually expected to pay more.\n\nI definitely recommend this. + Whatever estimate you imagined, you might want to add another 20%-30%.  I was charged $99 for the removal of an 18 year old Toshiba 27 inch television.  They guys were very professional and polite, but they are careful not to disclose pricing over the phone. During the call they claimed the cost would be determined by the space the items took up on the truck. NOT TRUE! They have a fee schedule broken out by item. They figure if the guys are already there and you want to get rid of the stuff bad enough, you'll pay it. That's what I did--now I'm kicking myself.  Bottom-line is they get the job done, but you're damn sure going to pay for it. Call around before you commit!!! + Arrived on time, were friendly and efficient. They were very careful when removing things from our home; didn't scuff any walls, etc. A job well done! We would definitely use them again (and probably will!) + I had 4 moves with junk hauling last month in March.2015. Granted pricing is comparable with these other 2 but these guys from your company who came out to my houses did a stellar job. I asked one of the other junk guys I had to hire kinda on the spot in April s why they did not bring bags and brooms and dustpans, and got that look of \"what\", and when he said \"we don't sweep up the broken glass etc\"  and that was the turning point for me to have 1800-got-junk do the final 2 houses worth of junk removal and spent almost 2grand with 1-800-got-junk I was so happy with the service.\n\nI have already told as many people as I can NOT to use these \"other\" local hauling companies, and if I would have taken a video of your guys cleaning up after themselves compared to these other people I would have posted it on youtube + I was given a time slot of 10-12.  At 9:30, one of the men called and told me that they were still on their prior job and would be there closer to the end of the time frame.  Then at 11:30, I received another call saying that they may not be there at noon due to continued difficulty getting a hot tub removed.  The man stated that we would receive a discount if they arrived after 12.  They arrived by 12:30.  I really appreciated the calls and updates. Rarely is the customer given the courtesy of one call, let alone two! The team was friendly, professional, explained the process in detail, and best of all, did ALL the work! \nI highly recommend calling 1 800 GOT JUNK. + I was able to make an appointment for a 2-hour time slot the next day and received a reminder email that I would be called 30-15 min before my appointment to confirm the time.  No way to get an estimate or price beforehand.  Didn't receive the reminder call, so I called 30 min later and they checked and said they'd be there in 30 min.  They arrived and were polite but the price was too high.  I had a washing machine, 10 boxes of ceramic tile and one garbage bag and they first quoted $161.  They offered a $25 off coupon and that was still too high.  Then they wanted to know if I would do it for their lowest price of $125.  They said they usually charge $125 for a washer removal.  Although they were polite, their appointment execution wasn't that great and I thought the pricing was way too expensive."

         "These guys were awesome. Told them to remove 2 air conditioners they took 3. A excerbike and a old table metal frame. In & out in 15 minutes. Will use again if I have the need. + We bought an Amazon voucher for $99 that gave us 1\\/4 of a truck (supposedly a $247 value). We had a large pile of bricks, old cement blocks, tree limbs, bags of shingles, sticks, and other random yard refuse. We called and they quickly got us an appointment for the next day. They (Matt & Chris) showed up exactly on time and reviewed our pile and said they could take care of it for an additional $100 on top of our voucher. This was fine with us, as for $199 total cost they would do the hauling and loading of all that for us whereas our other only option was to get a dumpster for about $240 and do it ourselves. Anyhow, they were very friendly and got to work, constantly providing updates. Unfortunately, as they moved down the pile they ran into a bee nest, and one of them was allergic. However, they very kindly proceeded forward and just avoided the main bee area (note to others, inspect and SPRAY before these guys arrive). Anyhow, our load definitely took much more than 1\\/4 of the truck and they felt they had underestimated a little and didn't realize the number of bricks on the bottom of the pile, so we both agreed to up the final price to $150 additional on top of the voucher. So, this ended up being about the same cost to us, but we didn't do any of the work. Gave them each $10 for their help and hard work, and our yard is almost back to looking good (except the little pile still remaining for us to do Bee Battle with).\n\nOverall, these are good folks and provide you an estimate up front, so we were pleased. + Got a great deal on this company from LivingSocial. They honored it no problem, almost seemed to expect it. Two younger guys showed up on time and I had them move an organ (piano) for me through a few rooms and down a few stairs. They tossed it in the truck and now its not my problem anymore. Pricing starts at $140, but if you get a good coupon it won't cost you too much afterward. I wouldn't hesitate to call these guys again. + Haul out promised a price to us for a multiple load job.. Then because \"too much time went by between hauls\" they decided to not honor the price any longer.. So sorry that we had some circumstances beyond our control.. They frequently missed appointments and were late all the time.. Or would show up with a half full truck.. We put up with a lot since the price was so good.. But it just got real hard to deal with this company.. So now their competition is working with us.. You can't push your customers around and expect them to keep using you.. Especially when there is so much competition.. + Great service. Took everything away, even an old washer & dryer with no prep on my part. Definitely would hire again. + 1-800-HAUL-OUT is my go to for my rental properties junk removal. I called them and they scheduled me the next day, which was a Saturday. They arrived on time and promptly called me to double check on the job. Very good service and I recommend them to anyone I know! + The workers were on time and completed the job in a professional manner. I would refer them to my friends and family.\n\nThe workers went above and beyond of what was required in a timely manner. They returned promptly after emptying the load and returning to complete the job. \n\nUse the Yelp ad and you receive $50 off the price. The office was kind enough to allow me to process the coupon on site therefore facilitating the reduction in price.\n\nTo that end, I would refer them to others. + Negative 5 stars \nGo to another service.   Had them once years ago and it was good.  This time called 2 weeks ahead,   The scheduled day they didn't show up.  After calling twice I received a call back 2 1\\/2 hrs later.   Claimed their website crashed.  Calvin said he'd call back in about 40 minutes. \nNO call back at all.   Very disappointed.  \nWent with GI haul they were awesome.   Reliable and reasonable. + Yelp should stop posting discounts for companies because 1-800-haul-out did not honor this coupon and they charged me  $400 plus the $50 I paid on this site for 15 trash bags and a small chest to be taken away. I should've paid the $250 for the dumpster! Now this company is stuck with refunding the  $50 because Yelp doesn't seem to do refunds on the discounts they post . + The team of Bret and Greg arrived on a Saturday morning.  They were prompt, courteous and removed a garage full of furniture and old sports equipment without any problems.  I will not hesitate to call them for future removals."

         "1-800-PACK-RAT",
         "My mother in law used Pack Rat to move her belongings from PA to Florida. She paid extra money for a delivery on Friday. Pack Rat contacted her and said it would not be available for delivery until Monday! We informed them this unacceptable. She is disabled and there are things she needs. The person then told us Saturday morning it would be here. We ended up calling them Saturday at 11:45. We were told it would not be here until Monday!\nVery very disappointed with this company. This is the third time using them and this is the worst!! If we knew that they could not keep the promised date then the things she needed we would have made other arrangements. But what is disappointing is we were told on Wednesday that it would be here Saturday before  noon and now nothing. + This is a great company, great customer service, and phenomenal management. For any of your storage, moving needs, etc., they are second to none! + When my husband died, I was left with a home to sell in CO.,and his garage and workshop, plus our belongings to deal with.  Much of this needed to get to family in IL. After checking into moving companies, rental trucks, rental trailers, and the POD company (which wouldn't even bring a unit to my location in CO), my daughter in law suggested trying PACKRATS. \nWHAT A WONDERFUL COMPANY! \nFrom my initial conversation to make the arrangements, through the pick up of the empty POD in IL, the PACKRAT people were extremely helpful and accommodating of my needs. \nWith so many other things to do as well at such a terrible time in my life, I am so thankful for  PACKRAT and its wonderful employees! + My long distance move with PackRat started out great. They dropped of the container when they said would and they were right on time getting it out of the street when we were done loading it up. We stored our stuff with them for more than a year before we were ready to have the our things delivered. Their email invoices are terrible. They contain no information other than what they're going to charge on your card that month. Not even a customer or order number, which would be very helpful when calling to inquire about your account. Also, our monthly storage costs went up every few months. That was just annoying. \n\nWhen we wanted to the container delivered we discovered what it really meant when they say they cover 97% of the country. It does NOT mean they can get the container to most destinations. Our original move was scheduled for an address within 100 miles of one of their facilities, but we had a major change and landed somewhere that wasn't. The option they suggested was shelling out more than $1,000 to transfer our things from the container to a trailer. On top of that was a charge of nearly $2,000 to deliver. This price was based on the cost of the move plus the estimated 14' our things would take up in the trailer. Even though our new destination was half the distance of the originally planned move, the cost was 50% more. \n\nI chose PackRat because they offered me a $400 discount over the quote I got from another company. Nearly everyone I've spoken to on the phone has been polite and made attempts to be helpful within the limitations of their company. That's how they get you. Their monthly storage costs became significantly more than the other company and the total amount of money we ended up spending was absurd. My last gripe is that they have very convenient hours listed on their website, but they do not answer the phones outside of 'normal business hours' and ask you to leave a message. I don't know how they can get away with listing those hours. I'm so sorry I bothered with this company. + Super easy solution! I actually explored two options with Pack Rat: a) having them move me from IL to PA and b) having a moving company more me to PA and into a Pack Rat container. \n\nIn Chicago, where I was living, no storage containers are allowed on the streets for any length of time. However, if you are exploring this option in a city with similar rules, ask Pack Rat about their \"sit and wait\" option, in which they will drive the container to your location but not offload it. The driver will wait up to 2 hours while it's filled and then drive off. It's a great solution because so long as the container remains on the truck, it's just a moving truck and not in violation of any city ordinances. \n\nMake sure you get Pack Rat to send you their moving spreadsheet, though. I completed it and learned I had too many belongings to fit into their cross-country container. Alas. Thus plan b) having the container wait in PA for my belongings to arrive by standard movers. \n\nThis was also a great solution. The container was delivered two days before my movers arrived, they moved 2\\/3 of my belongings directly into the container and 1\\/3 into the house. Then Pack Rat came and carted the container off to its indoor storage facility until I need it again. \n\nI'm not entirely sure if I'm staying long-term in PA, so I opted for the long-distance container, which comes with pads and a lock. I paid a deposit and if I need to move the container long distance, they'll just lift it onto a truck and deliver it where it needs to go, charging me the remaining fee. If I end up in PA for the long-term, they won't charge me the long-distance move fee. Seems like a win win. \n\nNeedless to say, I spent hours on the phone with customer service, and they were extremely helpful. I'd gladly recommend Pack Rat to anyone looking to move or store. + 1-800-PACK-RAT is an excellent service that doubles for both moving and storage.  I was moving long distance, but hadn't picked my future residence so the flexibility was perfect for me.  Pack Rat stored my unit for approx. 2 months while I moved and lived in a hotel, then when I settled in my new place they delivered to doorstep.  The guys that operate the trucks are wizards and were able to fit my unit in my tight, urban streets.  I talked to reps both on the phone and in person and everyone was incredibly helpful and truly valued customer service.  I would definitely use them again. + I am so thankful that this company was able to help my father when the conditions were not the best. These guys that came and helped set up the \"pods\" were very friendly and accommodating. They did everything they could to make sure we were happy and satisfied. During a time of a quick move and when everything changes so fast,...it is great to have a company out there that takes that into consideration and goes above and beyond. \n\nThank you! + 100% recommended. I was moving from western PA to Long Island, NY ...First thing I noticed was the customer service and how great it was. They were really pleasant and easy to deal with, they followed up with me (good thing since I had a million other things going on...with the closing, the packing & moving, the little stuff...). Second, I don't drive a truck. Third, I needed to store my stuff for about a month because I was going somewhere temporarily and then to my permanent residence about a month later. \nI weighed my other options...it would have cost me almost double for similar options, and the cheapest options, once I included one month storage at a storage unit, plus gas, plus hotel, plus tolls, etc etc...it would have cost almost the same but would have been a lot harder on me trying to 1. Drive a truck, 2. Move and have the equipment back in 3 days, etc....I could go on and on but long story short, from the first customer service rep I spoke to to the final driver and to the follow up customer service rep who contacted me to see how my experience was, Everyone was great and I wouldn't choose another moving company or method if I ever have to move again. All my stuff was exactly in the same position\\/condition I left it in..no one has access to my stuff which I liked, and the drivers are very careful, friendly and punctual. I really can't think of one negative thing to say about this company!"

         "105.9 The X",
         "As a metal head I was introduced to 1059 The X with David Draimen's \"monkey noise\" in the song Down With the Sickness by Disturbed back in 2001 and have rarely changed the dial since. Over the past 10 years the station seems to have struggled keeping a hard rock format and have since incorporated a TON of alternative rock and \"stoner music\" (think Bob Marley, Sublime, 311, etc.). Honestly, I only like around 55% of the music I hear on this station anymore. So what keeps me listening from 6:30am when I start my morning commute till 3:00pm when my personal opinion of Mark Madden makes me put on my iPod or satellite radio? The DJs. And I don't count \"Double M\" \"The Super Genius\" aka MALE CHAUVINIST PIG, as a DJ. \n\nIn the morning, Tim and Bob keep me laughing with stories and jokes, and dumb callers. They keep me up to date on local, national news, international news, sports, and celebrity gossip. But the show is geared more towards the male demographic, so there is stripper and boobie talk as well. There are daily hilarious Darwin Award styled stories called \"Shallow End of the Gene Pool\" and a weekly \"Dumb Dumber and Dumberest\" segment where you can vote for the call that was the \"dumbest moment from the week that was.\" Every Friday they will also play a \"Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader\" style game where a caller plays against an attractive girl for prizes. If you don't mind some sexism, Tim and Bob will keep you entertained. \n\nDuring the working hours, Whipping Boy takes over the radio. Whip has a nice loyal fan base, and no wonder. He is genuinely a nice guy and does a lot of good in the community. Whip starts his program at 10am by playing 9 songs from the 90's. Every day at noon he, with listener help, chooses a theme and plays 6-8 songs to fit the theme. Examples include, 90's songs, Y2K songs, songs with colors n the title, etc. At around 1:15pm he plays the day time pick of the litter, where he plays a song and listeners vote via phone or text messaging on whether to keep the song or \"Dio\" it. If a song is \"Dio-ed\" Whip plays Rainbow in the Dark and belts along to the lyrics to \"cleanse the musical palate from the awful pick\". Alby Oxenreiter makes an appearance daily as well to talk sports. Whipping Boy does charity work. He frequently hosts successful blood drives and, as a dog lover, has the Washington Area Humane Society bring in a dog every Thursday to try and find him\\/her a home. (Can you tell I LOVE Whip?) \n\nMark Madden is on from 3pm-6pm. 'Nuff said. \n\nThen Abby takes the air from 6pm-10pm(?). \n\nNot the best station if you prefer older metal, but then again there aren't any good stations in the Pittsburgh area for that kind of fix. + I absolutely love \"The X!\" When I'm tuned into terrestrial radio, there is nothing else I listen to! Any review that talks about music that the station is spinning, is outdated. Alternative is a very liquid format, changing flow & direction regularly. So, personally defined ideals of what alternative is and isn't really are a moot point. Depending on your taste, you may like it, or you may not. Give it a listen though before dismissing it. Especially if you haven't in a while...\n\nDISCLAIMER: Hi \"DigbyOnTheX\" for a reason :) + So this is what's considered \"alternative\" these days? Nu-metal, big-label punk, and a little bit of reggae mixed with loads of grunge, Guns N Roses, and Metallica?\n\nMan, I can remember when you couldn't get Metallica on the radio. Then it was just stuff from the s\\/t  \"black\" album. \"One\" from ...And Justice For All was a special favor. \n\nCould they find a more obnoxious, slovenly host than Mark Madden, whose sports insight (as if we really need that much insight into pro sports) consists of him namedropping and imitating pro wrestlers while insulting his callers, most of whom must hate themselves? I've heard better post-game analysis from cab drivers.\n\nIf I didn't have to listen to this talking sack of lard at work everyday, I might be a happier person. \n\nSpeaking of pro wrestling, didn't he tank as a heel announcer when he worked for WCW? I mean, Bobby Heenan and Jesse Ventura were actually funny and were only pretending to be jerks. Madden just makes you wish he had another heart attack because he really is a rich, miserable jerk sans an ounce of true humor or wit. \n\nPoor Abby Krizner. She likes Arch Enemy, Lamb of God, and is obviously a true metal fan and musician (she plays in the Motorpsychos), yet has to play such garbage from bands like Drowning Pool, Paramore, and Three Days Grace. She also has to produce misogynist Madden's show.\n\nYes he hates women, unless they work in the sex trade of course. Listen to him talk about which female celebrities he wants to \"degrade,\" his adventures at various strip clubs, and his defense of Dubbya-as-an-NFL-QB Ben Rapistberger. The only women he ever has on his show are porn stars. \n\nWhen you're as offensive and embarassing to the city as Madden is, what other way is there to get hot chicks to sit on your lap but to throw money at them?\n\nI also couldn't give a damn if we like the same bands, UFO included. \n\nThere must be a lot of douchebag middle-class white guys out there who eat Madden's stuff up. It's kind of sad really, especially when there are truly thoughtful sports pundits out there like Dave Zirin who deserve a wider audience. \n\nThe rest of the X's hosts kind of blend together as does the music they play. Breakdowns, hip-hop beats, suburban kids screaming about breaking stuff and why their parents suck.

         "10th Street Tattoo and Body Piercing",
         "My cousin and I went here on Saturday night to get tattoos. She was in from Texas for our family reunion. Around 8 pm, we decided that we wanted to get tattoos together. I had one in mind that I've been wanting and she knew what she wanted too. I used Yelp to look for tattoo shops and most of them closed around 8 pm. 10th Street was open until 2 am and I read some reviews that said they do walk-ins, so off we went. When we got there, the shop was clean and there was a lot of quirky artwork and sketches around the shop. One of the artists greeted us and said that the wait would be 1.5 hours (which was fine with us). He took our names and what design we wanted and then went into the back. He came back out with another artist, Mook (the owner of the shop). He said he could take us right then and there! So we showed him what we wanted and he actually made some suggestions to tweak our designs to make them look better and then we sketched them. He showed us the sketches and then we went to the back to get tatted. We didn't get big designs and Mook was very quick and efficient. Each of our tattoos only took about 10 minutes. I have been looking for a tattoo artist in Pittsburgh and I have found one. I definitely would go back to Mook and recommend him to anyone looking to get a tattoo. + I did a search on Yelp to see who was good. Then looked at Facebook. Decided on Greg at 10th Street. To say I am pleased is an understatement. \nHe drew exactly what I wanted and gave me some suggestions that made it look even better.\nThe place was clean and Greg was awesome!!!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! + Two of my friends & I did that annoying, spur of the moment, \"Hey! Let's get tattoos!\" thing to commemorate our friendship & their upcoming wedding (which I am in). We did this in Morgantown, WV. Myself & one of the girls were tattooed there, & it was great work.  The other girl didn't have her ID on her, & since she looks 12, it definitely wasn't going to happen there. So we drove back to Pittsburgh, got her ID, & looked for someone open late & taking walk-ins...\n\nEnter 10th Street Tattoo. Bobby was super friendly (a trait that is unusual in tattoo artists, & therefore much valued). He was able to copy the design EXACTLY, for about $50 less than the other shop, & he made the whole thing a welcoming, kick-ass experience despite us not following great tattoo etiquette. Next time I come out to PA, I will be setting up an appointment with Bobby, & I know my other two friends plan on coming back also. Highly, HIGHLY recommend him. + I needed to find a new tattoo place since the last one I went to never returned my calls or emails. Did a search and saw the reviews of this place. 10th Street has an awesome atmosphere and good tattoo artists. I have been tattooed by Jeremy a couple times and he does awesome work. I highly recommend this shop for your tattoo needs. + Place is very clean and friendly. Received tattoos from Jeremy, Mook and Greg and I have never been disappointed!! Have referred friends to them numerous times. + Great experience! Craig was awesome, the pricing was fair. Three of us went in together and he was able to get us exactly what we wanted, with little tweaks to our ideas so that it looked better where he was placing them. If I lived local he would be my artist of choice! + I had an awful experience here, and unfortunately, I'll have to be reminded of it every day for the rest of my life. Upon walking in, the artists were arguing with several other customers. A client even came storming into the parlor, yelling at the artists about how rude and unprofessional they were. That should've been my cue to leave, but for some reason I stayed. Big mistake.\n\nI received a tattoo of a short quote from a book on my hip. It was far more painful than any of my other tattoos, and the artist rushed through it. They also overcharged me (they told me a price on the phone, then charged an extra 40 after it was completed). I was in excruciating pain for over a week after, and I bled like crazy. As the tattoo healed, I realized the entire thing was blown out. Not only is it very thick and dark, there is an awful blue haze all around the tattoo that looks like a permanent bruise. I am already looking into either having the blowouts removed or the entire thing, but it will be EXTREMELY expensive and it will take quite some time to save up enough money for the treatment.\n\nI don't regret the tattoo, but I can't even put into words how much I regret going to 10th Street Tattoo to have it done. It could've been a very cute tattoo if done right, but now it's just an eyesore. It affects my confidence and I tear up every time I see it.\n\nPlease do your research before selecting a tattoo parlor and MAKE SURE the artist you choose can properly execute what you're asking for. + My friends and I came down last night at around 9 to get small tattoos. We came in as walk ins and we're taken almost immediately. Greg was our artist, we showed him what we wanted and he priced them for us (my tattoo, about the size of two quarters, was $60!!) Greg was super nice and fantastic and made us all feel super comfortable, especially my friends who had never been tattooed before. If you want a quality tattoo in a friendly, clean place, stop in to 10th street and ask for Greg! + I got my septum pierced here earlier this month and i took it out today cause it was very infected and i realised it was pierced through not the upper cartilage, but the lower visible cartilage. I wondered why it hurt so bad when i got it pierced. I'm real bummed cause i have to wait a couple months before i can get it pierced again at a better, more reputable shop. + Susie is an awesome artist. Got two of us in on the same day we walked in and gave us flawless ink. Very clean shop and highly recommended :)"

         "Kind of hit or miss. It can be a great place to belly up to the bar for cheap drinks and to catch a game. Or it can be rather ghetto. Usually the first one though! + Awful. Disgusting the way they treated my former. She's 23 years old & they wouldn't let her in because her middle name wasn't on her credit card. They could have had a business of 22 people but made ONE of us leave. Not to mention they were extremely rude. 6 dollar pitchers are so not worth it + Most likely one of the best places in Pittsburgh if you like an extremely large vodka mixer. When we visited, they offered $5 pitchers of Smirnoff mixers that my girlfriend was happy to sample. In addition to serving it in a pitcher, they offer an enormous straw for those who are enjoying it as a personal drink.\n\nFor the beer lover, they have a selection of 6 beers on tap. However, their extensive selection of microbrews is one of the best in town. You can get just about any type of beer you want from any area of the country from their selection.\n\nThis is a smoking establishment that has one long bar that runs the length of the business. It is a metal top bar. In the area opposite the bar, the business has mirrors to build the illusion of a larger place (in my opinion it works).\n\nThey didn't have any food during our visit in the afternoon, but they appear to have the capability for fried foods, pizza and other bar foods available for anyone with an appetite when they have the friers on. + So I had got my two bars mixed up, but now I remember. THIS place, still had pumpkin beers in the cooler which I found slightly alarming considering it's probably 6 months old (We went on St. Patrick's Day) and that either means they aren't selling much beer, or they ordered too much... either way, that shiz is probably skunky lol throw it away and get with the times.\n\nAlso this place was a smoking bar so it smelled. I ordered a special drink that they made in a bucket. I thought it was a bit watered down, but I didn't say anything. The girl behind me was very dissapointed because she had 2 of them and she said there was hardly any alchol in them. + Great place to go with friends and have a drink. Love coming to this bar when I'm in town. Fun atmopshere, great drinks made by some great bartenders! + By far the best bar specials in Pittsburgh. 99 cent Coors light bottles all day on Sunday,  99 cent yuenglings all day on Tuesday just to name a few. Great service and decent TVs to watch sporting events. + There are so many bars to choose from when drinking on the South Side. 1311 has a pleasant, welcoming decor as well as fantastic big screens. My roommate and I had a great time going to watch a Pens game. It does get pretty full, but since I prefer to hit the bars earlier in the evening, it is less of a problem for me. Plus, I love the sign in their door saying that they think \"smoking is sexy + I don't think I ever came here without the sole intention of getting a buzz. Great specials, tv's, jukebox is always playing great jams. Gets a little crowded on the weekends, but hey, you already know that if you're crawling E. Carson on a Friday or Saturday night. + 1311 is the best bar in Pittsburgh. This, of course, is just an opinion of mine. I personally think good drinks and a fun atmosphere is the way to go when it comes to a bar. You absolutely cannot come in here and leave without making friends, or at very least having an amazing conversation. People watching is fun here, the cheap (strong) drinks bring in quite a interesting crowd. The music is good, it's diverse, so you don't get sick of hearing the same stuff over and over. They have a jukebox in the back if you care to take over DJing for a bit. They do have $5 pizzas. For those of you who enjoy craft beers, this is surely the place to be, as they have over 100 different kinds of crafts, and new ones in all the time that they post on https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/pages\\/1311\\/304411390374?sk=timeline . If you've never had a craft, just ask any of the staff and they will be happy to explain them to you, and find one you're sure to enjoy based on your palate. They also have 8 big screen HD TVs, and a projector, for you to enjoy all sports games possible.\n\n\nI'll admit, I am pretty biased. I'm one of their doormen, my name is Paul. On that note I'll add that I don't get paid for this, and I don't make any sort of commission. I just noticed that there are no up to date reviews on this place, so I thought I could leave some information. If you ever have any questions about anything, you are always welcome to ask me. I hope to see you at our bar soon, and I hope you leave some reviews for me to read! I'll leave a list of our specials below.\n\n\n$5 Captain & Coke pitchers.\nor (depending on the day of the week)\n$5 Smirnoff Vodka pictures. Any flavor with any mixer you could imagine. There are 1,000's of possibilities. Some of the common favorites are Coke & Vanilla (vanilla coke), Blue Pitches are blueberry vodka with sprite and Blue Curaçao to add some color, and watermelon or strawberry vodka with cranberry juice.\n$3 Fireballs or MiniBeers.\n$4 Grape or Cherry Bombs.\n$5 Pints of homemade Sangria. (Tastes amazing.)\n$2.50 Coors Lite aluminum pints.\n\nThey also have a few beer specials, but those change by the day, stop on by to see all of those. + Friendly staff and good weekday specials but this place is seriously as wide as most hallways. There are mirrors everywhere to make it seem bigger but all it does is make it so you can't avoid staring at yourself...which makes for an odd atmosphere."

         "The staff is wonderful and the community is nice but the quality of the apartment could be improved in some minor detailed ways. Some aspects of the building seem to have been just thrown together as fast as possible. It might have been due to moving residents in early. I am not sure. I moved in a week after my official move in date and my apartment was still needing some touch up paint and there were some minor cosmetic defects that needed to be fixed. + We are currenty staying at 1400 Main in a furnished, corporate 2 bedroom apartment.  So far we are enjoying it.  We were considering renting here permanently but came to the decision that it was just going to be too small for our needs.  However, I have to give a huge compliment to Maria, in the leasing office, who has been nothing but professional, friendly and accommodating to us. She has worked with our crazy schedule to get us in to see all of the different units and filled us in on all the amenities that are available here on the property.  This really is an awesome complex. The pool area is great, there are outdoor grills for use, a huge great room you can entertain friends in complete with a pool table, drinks in the entry area, package service, dog washing station and more.  It is walking distance to 4 or 5 different restaurants and there is garage parking.  It really is a luxury apartment and has super friendly staff. I recommend anyone new to the area, or those who are now working in Southpointe, to come and take a look.  Great location and terrific property. + Everything is simply fantastic! The entire building is always kept immaculate. The amenities provided are wonderful and very convenient. 1400 Main is a marvelous place to live!"

         "I really wanted to like this place, but I was truly disappointed.\n\nThe entire system from placing your order to receiving the final product is disorganized. I chose s'mores and was given vanilla ice cream with a single smushed up 1\\/2 graham cracker... Which you could not taste. The unlimited toppings are nice, but the flavored combos are virtually tasteless so make sure you load up on the toppings. Cost- too much, 14.00 for two people to have subpar ice cream. The location is perfect and it was clean. Unfortunately, the only thing enjoyable was the novelty, which fell flat as soon as you tasted the product. I hope it improves as time goes on + Been here a couple times, and staff is friendly and very good ice cream makers. They let you see the ice cream being made, and it is very cool to watch it all happen. The make your own ice cream idea opens the door for tons of possibilities, and the staff is friendly and very helpful! A great way to spend an afternoon there and at the surrounding businesses. + Agree with a review below, that you're paying for the presentation and novelty.  The ice cream was good, though a little difficult to eat sometimes - like the roll was too frozen or something.  \n\nI took my kids kayaking and then we came here, and the cost of the ice cream was as much as it cost us to go kayaking.  Ridiculous. \n\nAlso, it is extremely loud when the employees are making the ice cream.  I mean, loud like you can't hear the person sitting next to you.  I won't be back and I'll be surprised if this place lasts much longer on Wash Rd. + It's opening day and every one who walks in here today only has to pay $5.00 for their rolled ice cream. The regular cost is $7.50 which does include the toppings\n\nLike it's distant cousin over in Lawrenceville 15* Fahrenheit serves rolled ice cream. They don't have a very extensive menu list but they will have your own \"create your own ice cream\" coming soon.\n\nThey have two \"models\" on display. I did like the layout in that you place your order, they will then call you by name and you can watch your ice cream being made and then rolled out. They have tables where you can sit if you prefer to eat in and they don't validate parking for the garage. They also do not have gender neutral restrooms.\n\nI decided to order the \"Tis the season to be berry\" made with 3 spring berries including strawberry. After the rolled out my ice cream I chose some fruit toppings along with whipped cream and chocolate to go with it. It says on a sign that it is homemade but I did not get the opportunity to follow up on it.\n\nMy ice cream was good but seemed a bit hard because each time I tried to break off a piece it went flying all over the place. I'm giving the benefit of doubt since it is opening day. Also because it is rolled it has a lighter taste to it.\n\nI can see the novelty of it in this area but for families with kids this ice creams is going to be one expensive treat especially since there are at least 2 competitors on this same street. Expect large crowds for the time being because this is a novel approach to the Mt. Lebanon area. \n\nNext time I'm in the area I will try a different flavor or see if my create my own ice cream is available. I will also try to find out about a rewards program. Located very close to the Mt. Lebanon North parking garage. Street parking is also available. + I will give it 4 stars because it is all the craze right now. I honestly was not a fan of the rolled ice cream. I would rather just eat regular ice cream or frozen yogurt. It is really solid and hard to eat and y'all know I'm not trying to have barriers between myself and my ice cream! But the 4 star rating is because the staff was friendly and it is cool watching them turn milk into rolled ice cream. You also get to top your ice cream from a choice of ingredients. Sort of like a frozen yogurt shop. If say stop in and give them a try! You may love it-- it just wasn't for me! + So much potential..... After hearing about rolled ice cream from my daughter's recent trip to Thailand, I was very excited to try this place.  I'll have to try again after they had a chance to work out the kinks.  At this point in time, it's not worth the $7 cost.  For this visit I had the mango strawberry.  One strawberry and three pieces of mango go in to a large cup of ice cream.  Once they were chopped up in the ice cream, it was impossible to make out the flavor.  It could be that the fruit wasn't ripe enough to have much flavor, or they simply didn't use enough.  It tasted primarily like plain ice cream.  The rolled nature of it was all in presentation, not flavor.  \n\nAdditionally with all the chopping and scraping and people talking, it was very loud.  They need to put something on the walls to reduce the noise level.\n\nI'll give it another try, but for a new exciting option, it was all disappointment. + We were intrigued by this fairly new ice cream establishment and elected to give it a try.  It's similar to Coldstone.  When you walk in, you give your choice of about a dozen store-created mixes or a build your own option.  I choice the coffee with a blend of real blueberries and oreos.  After you order it, another employee mixes and mashes your combo into several small ice cream wraps.  It reminds me of the days when I used to eat fruit roll ups as a kid.  Then, another employee puts your choice of toppings on the finished cup.  It's a pretty interesting idea, but when the place is packed you can barely hear your name being called.  There's also a lot of loud banging by the employees in making each person's concoctions that was slightly annoying.  The employees all had a smile on their face and I would recommend to others. + I don't give one star ratings often but had to for 15 Fahrenheit.\n\nI based my rating on 3 factors: experience, price, and taste. As soon as I walked in, it was unclear where to go or what to do. I learned more from asking other customers on how it worked instead of the actual employees. It would have been great for someone to greet us at the door and explain the process or for there to be big signs indicating 'Order here' and such.\n\nAs far as price goes, it's expensive. For a cup of ice cream, $7.00 is too much. The one up side is that you get unlimited toppings. But when the ice cream rolls take up the whole cup, there isn't even enough room to make it worth that much money.\n\nLast was the taste. For $7.00 I really expected a great cup of ice cream. Instead the ice cream was bland and flavorless. For the cookies and cream you get one Oreo blended with your frozen sugar milk. For the s'mores you get a tiny graham cracker. For the banana Nutella you get one Nilla wafer and a little piece of banana. I think they just expect you to load up on candy at the end to hide the fact that the ice cream sucks. \n\nOverall, for the experience, price and taste this place missed the mark completely. It's too bad because the rolled style looks cool but unfortunately the novelty of the rolling process won't bring me back again. + I had to see for myself how the ice cream was made and of course how it tastes.   First off I was surprised by the price $7 for one serving. This frozen treat is a performance dessert. Each serving is custom blended, chopped, spread to a frozen sheet then Rolled. Yes you get unlimited toppings but for this price I can enjoy soft serve twice.  The rolled sheets are super cold and melt very slowly.  For me, the ice cream was a one time novelty. + Its very expensive, $7.00 per.  It takes a long time.  This is a good \"at the shore\" experience but in a neighborhood, not so much.  The ice cream was very cold and bland and had a lot of ice crystals from getting scrapped off the cold plate."

         "I took the advice of a friend and stuck with safe menu choices. Steak wasn't bad. Went back for lunch (Im staying two blocks away) and had very boring salmon and pasta.  Mediocre wine overpriced. Only bother to return at lunch cos it's too cold to walk further. \nHad stuffed cod....not bad, but tiny.\nWish DISH were open for lunch. + After driving around for an hour trying to find a place to eat on a warm Saturday evening a month ago, my friends and I stopped in here to eat a great meal.  It was just about full, but our party of four was able to get a table in the back room after a ten minute wait.  No problem, we saddled (I'm not sure if this is the right use of the word saddled, but it sounds right to me) up to the bar and had a drink.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered a cinnomon chicken dish that was stuffed with some sort of cheese I think.  I was skeptical ordering it, because I thought it would be too sweet.  Our server said it wouldn't be too sweet, she had recently tasted it.  The meal also came with a salad and side.  I realized when I was ordering, that this was my first \"proper\" dinner in quite some time.  Salad was the house garden variety.\n\nThe chicken ended up being quite the interesting (in a good way) meal.  The cinnamon was subtle, not to overbearing at all.  The potatoes I got were done well.\n\nThe place itself is slightly cluttered, but feel authentic.  This place isn't trying to be anything that it isn't.  The service was spot on, and overall it was a great meal. + Went here for dinner recently before a show at the Rex. Great convenient location right off Carson. From the outside looks nice and cozy and inviting and inside was welcoming as well. If you are in the front room (probably about 7 tables for couples) this is really nice but I don't think I would be too excited in the back room as it was pretty dark. Service was attentive, menus were nice (on IPADs no less), and noise was just right. \n\nThe draft beers were great and normal restaurant priced, the salads were excellent, and the bread was good. The entrees (both of us ordered pasta specials) were mixed - I loved mine and found it very well presented and flavored with a perfect portion. My wife's was very skimpy, looked like it came out of a can, and was okay tasting.\n\nI guess my main issue is the price. Of $25 pasta dishes, I just expect more.  That said, if I had another event in the area, I would give it another shot. + I really don't understand the negative reviews for 17th Street Cafe, but I guess tastes vary. I've eaten here a bunch of times and have always had a good experience. The first time, my parents were visiting from Philadelphia and the owner of the restaurant came over and had a nice long conversation with us about the Maxime Talbot Penguins-Flyers trade. Most of the times that I have eaten here I've had a very pleasant jolly enthusiastic waitress, which has further enhanced my dining experience.\n\nThe bread is good, the food is good, and while I've never had any room for dessert, the table next to us last time said that the dessert was good. Between my dining companions and myself, we've had at least one dish from each section of the menu and they have all been tasty. And the asiago pillows are delicious. \n\nMy one complaint is that 17th Street Cafe does not give you a choice of the side dish. Last time I mistakenly ordered the greens and beans as an appetizer and after I'd eaten them and the waitress had come back to take our main course order, I found out that my meal had the same dish as a side dish and I was told that I could not swap for another side dish. The greens and beans were delicious, but one was enough. + First, the good.  The service is terrific; very friendly, eager staff -- including the guy refilling our water -- who all seem to care deeply about patrons having a good experience.  \n\nI just wish the food had been as good.  \n\nWe started with the roasted sausage appetizer.  If the sausage was roasted, it was then sliced and sauteed in a fry pan.  Not a big complaint, but imagine paying $10 for about six pieces of nickel-sized sausage, each about 1\\/4 inch thick surrounded by onions, peppers over a piece of breaded, deep-fried cheese.  Not awful, but for $10?!?!?!?  $4 maybe.\n\nThe salad greens were a bit limp and several of my pieces were brown.  \n\nThe bread was bland \"white bread\" shaped like a baguette.   What startled me, though, were the individual packets of Land o' Lakes butter pads.   Honestly?  Fast-food butter in an \"upscale\" cafe?\n\nMy wife ordered Chicken and Prosciutto with Pasta.  If you're going to list an ingredient in the title, it should be featured in the dish.  There maybe a dozen very small pieces -- the diameter of a pencil eraser -- in the sauce.  So it was essentially chicken and penne pasta with a \"flavoring\" of prosciutto.  \n\nI had the Chicken and Shrimp over angel hair pasta.  Decent, but only three shrimp in the dish.  $27.00.  Pul-leeze.  \n\nI'm not a cheapskate.  I spend good money at a number of high-end restaurants in Pittsburgh (check out my other reviews).  This just seemed WAY too much for what the food we received.  \n\nAt least my Johnnie Walker Black was only $8.50.  I expected to pay more for that!\n\nDisappointed.   I was really hoping to find a good spot for dinner on the South Side.  I need to try Gypsy Cafe next... + At the request of a friend, I decided to try 17th St. Cafe for lunch today. I've been to 17th St. for dinner a few times but never considered it for lunch due to the prices. However, my friend mentioned that the prices are very reasonable for lunch and the menu offers a large selection of salads, sandwiches and entrees. She was correct. The menu had a large selection all priced between $8-12. But, the drinks were overly priced. My lemonade was $3 with refills costing more. That was almost half my entree! The drink prices seem more in line with their dinner prices. \n When we arrived the restaurant was about half full and we were seated immediately. Our waitor looked a little frazzled and overwhlemed but the more experienced waitress helped out as needed to ensure we had a good dining experience. \nI ordered the daily burger and a lemonade. The burger was juicy and flavorful. My only criticism is that it came out without bacon. This was disappointing as it was stated to have bacon and cheese when the specials were told to us. I was in too much of a hurry to send it back. My friend also enjoyed her chicken entree and the chef easily accomodated her request to sub grilled veggies for her pasta. \nWhen all was said and done we were in and out within fourty five minutes. Not a bad place to go for a sit down lunch. However, avoid ordering the iced tea or lemonade as you will pay $3 for a glass with mostly ice. + Back in the day, the 17th Street Cafe was one of the better quaint places to go for a special occasion or nice date night.  However, on a recent visit, I had noticed that the restaurant wasn't as busy, the food was not as good, and the service was lacking.  With so many new trendy, upscale places popping up in and around Pittsburgh and so much competition for small, expensive restaurants, 17th Street Cafe needs to step up it's game (like add new dishes, retrain the kitchen staff, etc) or go the way of Cafe Allegra. + We took a large group and everyone loved it.  The food was excellent and the service was even better! + My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I decided to finally use a Groupon we had purchased a while ago this past Saturday.  Normally, we would never really try an Italian restaurant (especially one at this price point) because quite frankly, it's very easy for me to cook a quality pasta dinner at home.  However, as I said we had a Groupon I didn't want to see go to waste. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was very laid back and relaxed yet professional, and the food was damn tasty (the house salad dressing is delicious) but I'm not entirely sure those things made up for the fact that in my opinion, it was way overpriced.  In the end it was spaghetti.  The PIC will definitely benefit from the pasta combination ideas I can apply at home. + Let me start with the good - the \"pillows\" were fantastic (definitely get these if you go here). The salad dressing was tasty. The waitress was very nice.\n\nNow, the not-so-good. \n\nThe tables were crammed in so close that my companion and I were distinctly uncomfortable. I could not get in to my seat (against the wall) without standing on my toes and squeezing through the space between tables (I am an average sized woman). The woman sitting next to me got up to use the restroom during the meal, and her butt almost touched my food, that's how close and small the tables were. We were crammed in so tightly that my companion and I were reluctant to have our own conversation for fear of interrupting those around us. \n\nThe bread was a baguette that tasted like it came in a can. \n\nMy companion's sausage and pepper ravioli was, he said, awful. There was not enough sweet to counteract the spicy, and he said it was drenched in some kind of sausage gravy that ruined the texture of the rest of the dish. \n\nMy dish, the chicken and asiago pillows, was actually pretty good. It was very rich and the chicken was done just right. \n\nOur dessert, an apple strudel, was alright, though I think I could have gotten a better (and cheaper) one at any local bakery. \n\nThe check was extremely slow in coming. The people next to us waited over a half hour for their check to be brought. (The guy was sitting there with his credit card out the whole time.) They almost left without paying because it was taking so long (trust me, I could hear their entire conversation.) And then they waited another 20-30 minutes to get the card back. Ours didn't take that long, but probably only because of the very obvious displeasure of the people right next to us. \n\nThe worst part? How EXPENSIVE it is. If this meal had cost $30, it would have been passable. It was nearly twice that much. For a place so cramped and expensive, the food was just simply not worth it."

I was expecting fresh calamari, but apparently it just came out of the freezer and tasted super fishy.  Gross!\n\nIt was a little uncomfortable sitting by myself at the bar.  No sports on TV and no one to chat with at the bar.  I definitely picked the wrong place! + A real nice burger...a good sized portion for a pretty good price. I got the Cajun burger which was really good. It could have used a little more flavor but still an excellent burger. I would recommend for a nice traditional American meal. + Ok so let me start out with breakfast is one of the hardest things to mess up. With that said let's begin. So I live like 3 doors down from this place so I was hoping it was decent so it can be an all the time place. Sadly it was nothing of the sort. So first off not one person was in there besides the couple that works there. Who were very friendly hence the 1 star rating. But it was so quite and uncomfortable. They had a couple tvs but they weren't on. So we could literally here everything going on in the back, everything including the microwave! Nothing in breakfast should ever be microwaved. Anyway we ordered simple French toast, bacon, eggs and my boyfriend ordered walnut pancakes. So the French toast was dry and flavorless tastes like bread that was soggy from water then someone cooked it. Then the pancakes literally had walnuts in them, like full sized chip your tooth kinda walnuts. To top it off I instantly smelled that the microwaved object of the meal was..... the bacon! Who in the world finds it acceptable to serve the only customers you have MICROWAVED BACON?! Unholy really. Anyways the cherry on top of the cake was this meal took like 45 minuets to make and everything was terrible. But the thing that got me the most was the cook came out at the end and was like \"sorry for the wait everything is cooked to order on weekends\" So why in the hell was it terrible and microwaved? Needless to say we barley ate anything and will never go back. All in all it was uncomfortable, and pretty much the worst breakfast I had in Pittsburgh. Unfortunate because they seemed really nice. + I passed by this place and just decided to try it. I tried their burger. Man..it was so good. Best bang for the buck. Especially if you're a student.. I had plenty of fries. Completely stuffed. =) Definitely coming back here again. + On a Saturday morning we were looking for an alternative to the usual Tom's Diner brunch. (One's stomach can only stand so much bland tasteless somewhat overly \"moist\" food.)\n\n1889 is found on East Carson Street with street parking available. Although if you're like us (forever pedestrians), the bus drops you off just a block or two from the cafe.  The restaurant was about half empty, which was a nice surprise for a Saturday morning. Somewhat low lit, but high ceilings and a lot of seating made it seem open and airy. The art on the walls is a bit dated, but good for a laugh.\n\nWe were able to pick where we wanted to sit, so we picked a table in the back. A large party consisting of louder women was seated next to us. It was surprisingly not intrusive, I don't know if that was due to the architecture inside the building or just how pleasant the day was. Our server was very very quick to take our drink orders and bring us our coffee before taking our order. \n\nThe coffee was general diner fare. Nothing fantastic, but not burnt sludge you find in some places. The menu had a huge variety of omelets and other breakfast foods. I ordered the spinach\\/tomato\\/feta omelet. The omelet came with homefries and toast. I also ordered a side of bacon. The portions were HUGE. The omelet was gigantic and the portions on the potatoes and the bacon was great. The ingredients were fresh and it was apparent in the taste of the food. \n\nA great morning after a night out brunch. Really fantastic. The best part, the meal was fresh, the portions huge, the atmosphere was relaxed but boisterous, but best of all... it was way cheaper than going to Tom's. The staff was exceptionally friendly and very apologetic that the credit card machine was down.\n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an alternative to the norm. + A great spot for breakfast. I love to sit in the window, drink coffee and wait a long time for my delicious home fries while recovering from a hangover. \n\nThe service isn't the quickest, but the food is good classic reasonable diner food with a nice location. The bar is an old hardwood behemoth that spans the long restaurant, and you can feel the history while eating here. They also have some tables outside and specials every Sunday morning.\n\nThis is also a fine lunch spot. + Ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast.\n\nThe food is consistently okay but not great.\n\nThe staff are also ok. \n\nOverall the place is remarkably average in an area with places that are much much better. + This place has a serious identity crisis. The facade of the building looks interesting and authentic, like it would be a place to get a great beer, meet some interesting people and eat good bar food. The inside, however, has the Disney channel blasting on the flat screen and horrible drinks. There was one waitress for the entire place, who apparently was the owner's wife, and was getting no help from the owner who sat and watched her work. They had a $4 Bloody Mary special, so I gave it a go; and I tried the bacon cheeseburger. The Mary was so bland and boring. It came with no fixin's, was made with tomato juice, cheap vodka and pretty much nothing else. The burger was OK. I doubt I'll be back here. + We were in the Southside looking for someplace new for breakfast when we just happened upon 1889 Cafe. More of a bar\\/pub than a cafe, we were seated rather quickly. The menu was somewhat sparse, but we chose the following:\n\nHam and cheese omelet\nTwo eggs, bacon, toast, home fries\nWedding soup\nPancake\n\nThe soup came out first and I tried it. Anyone that has read a small number of my reviews knows that I have an aversion to items that taste too salty and that I have a fairly sensitive tongue when it comes to salt. The soup was so bland, I actually added salt to it. Yes, that is right, I added salt to an item. After the added salt, it actually had an okay flavor about it.\n\nBreakfast is a fairly difficult meal to destroy or get wrong, and 1889 cafe did fine. They didn't destroy the meal, but they also didn't make it memorable. As my partner would say, \"It wasn't made with love.\" \n\nI see no reason to return. + I have never seen more the seven diners in 1889 Cafe at one time. Seriously. I'm amazed that they're able to stay open, since I'm sure East Carson real state ain't cheap. \n\nThe upside to the lack of clientele is that the food comes out fast. Prices are slightly high, but the burger and fries are tasty, and my friends love the  chicken stirfry. It's great for when you want to go out to lunch and not use your entire hour."

         "1902 Tavern",
         "I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh, and we came here towards the end of our class.\n\nThey had a sign on the curb outside that said they had \"the best prime rib\".  Now, I don't think I can say that they had \"the best\", but it was very good, and a pretty big serving too.\n\nOur waiter (John) was exceptional, excellent service, fun personality, very knowledgable. + Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!! + I like the 1902 Tavern.  It received the first liquor license in western Pennsylvania in 1902.  True, there are better choices and I'm essentially a non-drinker.\n\nBut, hey, what do you expect for bar food in Downtown?  I had a burger and fries which were as good as any I've had.  The best day to go is on any Thursday on \"Market Street Thursdays\", from June to August. Sitting outside, listening to the band while eating.\n\nNot a bad place to be! + You win some and you lose some.  That just about sums this place up for me.  Nice to see that a historic bar is still standing anywhere in the USA.  Too bad the food offerings seemed to be just about as old as the subway tiles and woodwork.   (I must say that I ate at the bar and didn't go down into the restaurant.)\n\nTake a deep breath before entering and hold it until you get to the bar area.  The place smells like a college watering hole; maybe that's because drinks have been spilled on every inch of this place over the many years its been open.  Once you get to the bar you'll be drawn in by the woodwork, tin ceilings and friendly vibe.  Bartender was really nice and offered some suggestions when he realized the Newcastle line was frozen.  It must happen regularly because he sent someone downstairs to fix it and in about 20 minutes it was working again.  He even poured me a shot of this pomegranate lemonade mixture that was pretty tasty.\n\nThe menu didn't excite me but I have to say that most of the food I've seen so far in Pittsburgh doesn't do much for me either.  Opting for an appetizer, I went with this banana pepper stuffed with Italian sausage (hey, it sounded interesting).   It was forgettable, and smothered with marinara to the point of being overwhelmed.  Oh well, the beer was cold, the bartender was nice and they even switched the TV to my game in between periods of the Pens game. + Market Square was not quite what I expected. Maybe it was the fact that most of the buildings around it seem to be under construction. There were people out and about in the square and eating outside at the 1902 Tavern. The inside was as described by others. I ate at the bar and the bartender was attentive. \n\nThe food is typical pub grub, burgers, chicken sandwiches, and the prime rib. There was some guy at the end of the bar drinking, watching the Pirates and going on and on about the prime rib to some other guy that had the misfortune of sitting nearby. Needless to say I had the Landmark Chicken Sandwich. It was good food. Not the best I've ever had, but good and inexpensive. My beer and sandwich came in about $13 before the tip. \n\nThe atmosphere wasn't great inside the restaurant, but there weren't many people in there at all. This was a Monday evening. + Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile . + phone is disconnected although web site\\/homepage is still active."

         "Yummy. Loved it here. Just tried it tonight love the fact of byob and no fee. We had the fried calimari. It was very good. The wedding soup was also tastey. For dinner I had the gnocchi Tuscany. That sauce was so good I could have lick the plate. My partner had the chicken parm. Which the portions are huge. The chicken was excellent moist and a nice breading. The sauce was really good. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone. + I've had lunch twice, the Italian food is really pretty good. It its very fresh and portion to price ratio is very good. The restaurant is a bit noisy and the neighborhood isn't improving, but the food is worth a trip, I'm still not sold on the bakery. It was better on my second trip but still really pricey. + Nice little family run place with good food. They are a BYOB with no corkage fee which is nice!\nThe atmosphere is nice in a remodeled early 1900's building with period correct decor. The wait staff is nice and the chef stopped by to see how our food was. Would definitely recommend. + Been there 3 times.   It has been great every time!  Great authentic Italian food. \nLots of choices on the menu. \nYou cannot go wrong with any thing they have to offer. \nI would recommend the Eatery to anyone who enjoys delicious food. \nGreat friendly service too! + The service is amazing.  They have fantastic food I've never been disappointed. My entire family can come here and everyone finds something they enjoy. I recommend the linguini in white clam sauce. + Totally a fan of this cozy, clean lil eatery serving wonderful italian food.  No skimping here on portions.  I've tried several dishes and havent been disappointed....except for some very mushy angel hair....which I love...but they graciously changed it out for linguine which was AWESOME!! Cooked perfectly al dente.  Their wedding soup, chicken parm, veal Romano, salads, grilled veggies on the appetizer menu...YUM!!! You cannot go wrong. Call for reservation, especially on the weekends, packed. Workers very sweet, very 'homey' feel. I love the BYOB, and no price gouging for the cork fee...it's FREE!! I will be a frequent flyer!! + Food was a 9.5 (delicious, huge portions) \nAmbiance was a 6 (clean, but very noisy)\nService was a solid 4 (and pretty weird, tbh) + Authentic Italian! This little gem gets 5 stars. It is a byob (which I love) and they DO have wine glasses. Maybe they didn't have them when they first opened, but they absolutely have them now. The food was to die for! There were 5 of us, and everything I tried was phenomenal!! Very clean, excellent service. Highly recommended, and defiantly plan on going back. + The food is still delicious but... the waitress had on dirty clothing. The owner was out and about and never came over to our table.  Our party was one of two or three small parties.  It was not busy.  We had to ask for coffee, ask for dessert...we did get refills on water.  I felt sad. + Let's just say it wasn't the greatest experience...first off when my wife called for a reservation, that should have been he clue.  Not very nice and basically hung up on her.  Then when we did get there, it took about 20 minutes to get water.  Never did get any better.  Once we ordered, it took nearly 2 HOURS to get the food.  If it hadn't been for the people we we're with, we would have been out!  About an hour into the wait we were told that the owner was the ONLY person cooking and would not allow anyone to help, hint, hint, he never cooks she said.  Well, needless to say, if he doesn't cook, then I didn't trust that the meal would be right.  Well, food was ok, just not totally hot and we didn't even want to send it back because who knows how long it would've taken then!  So,  to help offset the long wait, they gave us dessert.  That wasn't too bad, but it will be a long time to never going back.  Because of the owner's actions, he lost some patrons.  I know it probably doesn't matter to him, but it does to us.  By the way, if I could have given 0 stars, I probably would have."

         "This is the worst service I've ever received in my life. 45 minutes for drinks and he forgot half our order. The food sucks. Do not come here for a good meal. + I met 2 friends for an early dinner last night. We shared four of the 2 for 1 happy hour specials which was more than we expected. The egg rolls were our favorite. \n\nThe menu selection was limited but included vegetarian options. The wine and beer options were adequate. \n\nWe are all planning to return, I heard their mac and cheese is superb. + The perfect place to grab a drink with a friend or two, I absolutely loved the fries and drink that I ordered (it was the special, a very delicious summer drink). I've only been here once, but my experience was incredibly enjoyable. My friends and I are definitely heading back soon! + Full Disclosure: if I was rating 1947 for both dinner and drinks I would go 4 maybe even 3 stars.  But for me, there are plenty of places around to dine.  There is only one place to drink bourbon.  That is what this review is for, my neighborhood bourbon bar, not my neighborhood dinner spot.  \n\nThe bartenders get some heat here because they take a while to make a drink.  But my question is: would you rather have a sloppy drink made quickly or an immaculate drink made slowly?  For anyone who appreciates the art of bartending, it's not a question at all.  All drinks are measured and poured with accuracy and in the proper order (absolutely the correct way despite what any quick-tips may say).  The tenders are knowledgable about their bourbons, the ones I've talked with understand the nuance of flavor and use this knowledge accordingly when subbing different bourbons into classic cocktails.\n\nIf you want to drink bourbon in Pittsburgh, there is only one place to do so and know that you are in capable hands. + This is part a. of what will surely be a longer review, as we were only there to try their bourbon cocktails, and didn't sample anything from what looked like a delicious new-American menu (ok, so we did get a slice of bourbon pecan pie, but no dinner entrees!). \n\nWe tried their Sazerac, mint julep, and their house Tavern drink, which reminded me of a fall-spiced Manhattan. Definitely a great bar spot--a small restaurant with big potential in Shadyside. + One of the best places in Shadyside to hang out with friends and a creative cocktail.  Feeling daring?  Order a drink at the mercy of the bartender and they will make you whatever they feel like making.  So much fun and super delicious.  Don't forget to order the Gnocchi Tots! + i used to live a block a way and have been here a lot.  it's a nice space, cooler bar ambience without a douche edge.\n\ni'm giving it 5 stars because i had my best pittsburgh burger experience here. i had the one with port reduction and bleu cheese.  it was a perfect medium rare.  mmmm. \n\ncocktails take a while but are ok, sometimes a little too strong but depends on your goal for the night. + The burger (I just asked for a plain one) was great. As we're the fries. The beer choice was excellent (had a bitter and porter). The waiter was friendly, helpful, and had strong opinions (against) serving ketchup in ramekins. Nice back patio. Little expensive for my budget, but a great place. I'd go back for sure. + I've been here twice now and plan to go back. It can get kind of busy (first time I went my group had to squish into a small booth), but if you go early during the happy hour there are plenty of seats and good drink deals. I mainly love the fact that there is a bourbon bar here in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe last time I went, my friend and I got frozen bourbon lemonades. The bartender was super friendly and nice, since I was the first person there. We chatted a bit, and she called the frozen bourbon lemonades \"adult slushees.\" Spot on and delicious! It would be perfect for a hot summer day. It also looks like there are some solid food options, which I'll have to try next time.\n\nThe drink prices are on the higher end for Pittsburgh, but I also usually go for cocktails and 1947 Tavern is a nicer venue for drinks. I believe the bartenders actually know what they're doing and try to be creative with the drinks. Happy hour there is an awesome deal, so hit that up if you can! + The back area is nice in the summer\\/fall time. Food is ok, a little overpriced. (They do have carlsberg on tap so I like going there for that). \n\nThe service can be hit or miss, it is usually very very slow which is a bit frustrating at times. The people are very nice though. You have your choice of a number of different bourbons and it's fun trying out their different signature bourbon drinks. I usually go for my regular knob creek with ginger ale but if i want to get out of my comfort zone I will go for something off of their list.\n\nIt's worth checking out for sure."

         "20/20 Opticians",
         "Can't say enough good things about these folks,  Friendly, fast, honest, simple, wide selection and very accommodating.  \nWhen my beloved optometrist (with really cool frames) retired and closed his practice, I was devastated.  Then my dog chewed up my glasses and I needed to find a new optician fast!  \nAfter shopping around several places in the eastern parts  of Pittsburgh,  a friend told me about her favorite -  20\\/20 in Greenfield. \n Right away, I knew I was in the right hands. They helped me find the ideal frames and created the prescription lenses in house!  Like, in two days! No out of town lab. \n\n They genuinely care about their customers' satisfaction.  It's wonderful.  Nice people. I totally trust them and would recommend them to anyone. + I don't think I have ever written a review on yelp before.  My experience with 20\\/20 opticians was so wonderful, I had to write this.  I went in for an eye appointment on Thursday at noon.  I was given the most thorough evaluation I have ever had.  Dr. Rudavsky found out that I needed prisms in my glasses because my eyes are not level---something no other doctor has ever noted in the 30+ years I have been wearing glasses.  \n\nThen on to the new glasses themselves--- I have a strong prescription, bifocals, featherweight and now prisms.  Every other pair of glasses I have gotten has taken at least 2 week.  Not at 20\\/20.  I got a call saying they were ready THE NEXT DAY---less than 24 hours after I had my exam. + So, despite leaving for a trip in just a few hours and desperately needing a quick nap, I have to write this review!  I made an appointment at 20\\/20 after reading the rave reviews and managed to snag an appointment prior to my trip.  I've been in desperate need of contacts and my glasses needed upgraded as well.  The staff are incredibly nice and welcoming!  I arrived at my appointment early and the doctor was actually able to take me a little early!  My paperwork was already ready upon my arrival to be sent out to my insurance company which they handle, along with the paperwork for my frames.  \n\nMy appointment went by lightening fast and I was set up with trials for contacts and picked out frames for glasses!  I mentioned that I had a trip and wouldn't be able to pick my frames up on the anticipated pick up date.   They offered to ship my frames to me when they were done!  I declined as it would only be a short trip, but this morning I received a call that my glasses were ready to be picked up!!  I was shocked!  I can't say this enough, do yourself a favor and make your next eye exam with Dr. Rudavsky! + I've been a customer since 20\\/20 opticians opened in 1980. Barry and Evan are world class. From glasses to reading glasses to contact lenses, 20\\/20 opticians have it all. And the prices are very very reasonable. I highly recommend them to everyone. + Barry and Evan are the best! Don't waste your time at that pompous Pittsburgh eye wear chain. These guys will make your glasses cheaper and faster, and the service here is unbeatable. I send everyone here, and no one has ever been disappointed. Sure, their shop doesn't look fancy, but they have great quality frames and lenses, and they carry many of the same brands and designers that you'll find in the up-scale shops.\n\n+ I left my glasses in a hotel room, and they had another pair ready for me the NEXT day.\n\n+ My husband called to cancel my eye doctor appointment because I had a migraine. The next time I saw Evan he asked me all about it, showing genuine concern. He remembered.\n\n+ I walked in there after over a year, and Barry recognized me right away. He even remembered some random details about me including some glasses that I was interested in.\n\nThey take most major insurance carriers.\n\nThey're affiliated with the ophthalmologist next door so if you need an eye exam, you can schedule with him. (He's great!) See listing for Zarky Rudavsky, O.D. + I came into the shop on a Friday, they had multiple frames right off the bat that were sturdy, stylish, and affordable. (I'd been looking for new frames for months and as a big guy it's hard to find a pair that's just right). The selection here is clearly curated by someone with a classic sense of fashion. Other shops were really hit or miss, I had 4 pairs to choose from at 20\\/20\n\nThe optician was low key and extremely helpful, called for my rxn at my ophthalmologist (he offered to do a new prescription on site as well). \n\nI got my new glasses the next Wednesday. Three business days for new glasses plus a really quality customer service experience: I'm never going anywhere else! + This place is amazing. They were exactly as available as myself (early 20's collegiate with discriminating taste - so not at all) and my mother (early 50's, very indecisive, essentially looking to have her hand held through the process of sizing up glasses - so a lot of attendance, advisement and attention) wanted them to be, without having to explicitly communicate these desires. \n\nThe frames are cool. Particularly, they span the gap between the Eyetique eccentric - frames with uniqueness at the cost of following no known design principles, and generally ones that I find incredibly unflattering - and the mundane of Visionworks or Lenscrafters. They have some very conservative frames that follow along the lines of lenscrafters, and then they go all the way out the spectrum until they run into the \"no known design principles\" territory, and stop right at its edge. It's great. \n\nI found a pair of frames that are not sold anywhere else in pittsburgh that are metal-framed thickly on the top and thinly on the bottom - a 50's kind of look usually associated with plastic frames with colored top framing and transparent bottom framing - that are perfect for my pretty abnormally proportioned face. \n\nIt services myself, my mother and my brother now. It's an excellent, kind, and clearly hard working set of brothers that own and run the place. \n\nIt took them two days to have my glasses ready, and one day for my mother's. \n\n5\\/5. I commute from shadyside to here to get my glasses, and have my optical exams next door at the also-outstanding Dr.Rudavsky's optical.\n\np.s. I have been a customer for three years, after my mother advised me to try them for finding frames. I was late to post a review because, first you think you want to create a yelp account to help get the word out about the good ones, but you know what? Things come up. + When I started to need reading glasses (based on my eye exam next door with Dr. Rudavsky), I went here, as my wife was already a customer. They are fantastic! They have a great selection and prices. The owners, Barry and Evan, provide incredible service. They don't try to up-sell you, and they make sure you are happy with your glasses. \n\nCase in point - when I lost those glasses after I moved out of town, Barry was able to track down the frames I had, updated the prescription, and shipped out a new pair the next day, again, at a great price!\n\nThis store is a textbook example of a great, local merchant that you'll come back to again and again. I love this store! + 20\\/20 is the best place for frames and service in the city.  I found them on Yelp after having medicore experiences at so many places, and I'm thrilled that 20\\/20 came exactly as advertised from the other reviewers here.  Great selection, service, price, honestly, don't waste your time going to other opticians.  Barry is very low key, very kind, it was just a great experience from start to finish. + I also agree with the first review. I found 20\\/20 through Dr Rudavsky, who I also found here on Yelp, and who I also thought was wonderful and thorough and thoroughly professional. And, of course, he is a real doctor, not a sales person like the dork who examined my eyes at the fancy Pittsburgh place. \n\nAs for the glasses -- couldn't be happier. Saving up to get a few more pair filled. Barry and Evan are indeed the best.  I am a bit of a collector of odd\\/vintage frames, so I didn't have the same concern as P.D. For me, the prices for lenses alone at 20\\/20 were so good that I had two other pairs of frames fitted with different prescriptions. \n\nAnd when one of them didn't work out for me -- through no fault of theirs, let me hasten to add -- they replaced the lenses and wouldn't let me pay. \n\nPlease read that last sentence again. Happy happy."

Being who I am....I ignored them. Two days later, I try to drive the car and when I hit the gas, nothing happens!! I call Jeff, and he actually came to my house to get the car. He gets it to the shop and can not find a problem (the car was running fine, but the lights were still on). He brings it back, it seems fine, so I take it to GE, get there fine, then again the gas does nothing when I am leaving and now the headlights are coming on when the car is completely off. EEEK! So I call Jeff again. He comes out, in the rain, jumps my car, pulls out the automatic starter box, but it still doesn't work. I have it towed to a garage. They find one small wire that was clipped when the starter was being put in...Car works fine now, but I have a $124 bill for the mechanic.

I have been looking everywhere for a sticker for my car and she showed me one example and it was exactly what I have been looking for! Very quick with emailing back and fourth and great customer service! Is there 6 stars? Lol + Jeff recently installed a ceiling mounted DVD system in my Ford F-150.  After asking others for help and a price they just could not commit.  Jeff is very professional and helpful.  I had requested some work that they had not done before.

I mean, really...try to understand the business you're reviewing; not all places are all things to all people. Just because your expectations of what a coffee place should be aren't met doesn't make the place bad or overpriced or pretentious. It makes it what it is trying to be, and if it's not that, then you can criticize. \n\nThe ambience is definitely not warm, but I appreciate it. A spare room with some even sparer outside seating. Music playing, but very quietly in the background (a very nice change from so many places!) These guys do what they do and they do it well. Don't expect breakfast sandwiches, gluten free muffins, and soy caramel venti lattes! Just expect very smooth handmade coffee and a quiet place to sit and meditate on the beauty of well crafted caffeine. + This is a terrific little place that takes its beverages seriously, but not too. It's small and cozy, and felt like a good place to linger for a while. I could not on my visit, but I did find out that tea is just as important as coffee here. My green tea took a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. This isn't a cafe to dash in and out of if you're in a hurry, but it's quality. + Love it!!  In a country that is obsessed with having everything fast, this place simply will not sacrifice quality for speediness.  Everything is done here by hand and done the right way.  Only the best ingredients are used and the people that work there really like coffee and are good at what they do.\n\nThe espresso is amazing, quality like this is not achieved at many other places Downtown where speediness is king.  So yes you are going to be waiting for your drink to be customly made for you but I can tell you it is well worth the wait.\n\nIf it is \"regular coffee\" you are looking for, they also have filter coffee made by the \"pore over method\"\n\nIf you are in the area and really want to treat yourself to good coffee, this place is an absolute must. + I visited this cafe last week for the first time. I really enjoyed the ambience, more importantly my coffee was beautiful prepared before me. The barista Molly was very helpful in directing me in my choice. + This place is for snobs ran for snobs. If you like over the top preparation for a special cup coffee than this place is for you. + We showed up with six people. Three hot-chocolates, a latte, a cap, and a chai were purchased, tasted, shared, and thoroughly enjoyed! This place is simple, clean, pleasant, and makes phenominal drinks of all sorts. A much needed oasis on a cold cold day! + If you are looking for a good cafe latte, you will find it here. Great in and out place. The only downside; it's closed on the weekend. + I'm torn about this place. The coffee is really good, and the staff knows their stuff. However, they make a big show of making the coffee in crafty ways, that i feel might be unnecessary. They make a cappuccino right, but brewing a single cup of coffee in a complicated single finter ceramic cone, draining into a caraffe that is then put in cup seems excessive. Just brew it in a regular coffee maker... a cup of black joe doesn't require all that. And it isn't any better (i could see if they used something that makes a difference like a french press). \n\nAlso, my cup of coffee was nearly $4. Again, good coffee, but I can get a great cup for 99 cents at Dunkin Donuts, so I don't see much reason to get it here for $4.\n\nThe staff is really nice, and the place threw me back to my college's on campus coffee shop and i was right back in my freshmen year- bright eyed, bushied tailed, thinking I could do something in this world... full of hopes and dreams, and plans and goals. That was a nice perk. \n\nIf you want a complex drink (capuccino, latte, etc.) done right, this place is alright. If you just want coffee, go elsewhere and get more bang for your buck(s). + The mocha is bomb.com. Very cool vibe, they play good music, it seems to be David Bowie hour and I dig it!\n\n Cant wait to come back and try more + I didn't even realize 21st St. had a location downtown until I randomly walked by and jumped in immediately for a cup.  Got the pour over (Costa Rica I think), which was fantastic.  Other assets of this location include friendly service and plentiful outdoor seating.  Definitely good to have a place like this downtown where one can get legitimately amazing coffee."

         "This place has seem to hit its stride. Good food, quick service. Great place for lunch and coffee! + Full disclosure, I come here a lot. Having said that, every single time I get take out I go back to work and exclaim \"this is the last time I'll ever eat there!\" Only to slink back the next time I forget to pack a lunch. \n\nThe inconsistency is borderline schizophrenic & that really bums me out, everyone who works here is incredibly nice & I like them all but, no one really knows how to cook here. I started ordering all my sandwiches cold because I couldn't bring myself to pick wilted lettuce and mealy tomato out of the sandwich after it was crushed in the panini press and somehow was still cold in the center. The menu and the prices seem to have stabilized but, for a while they both seemed to not only change daily but to change between orders. \n\nAlso, can we just call this place what it is? It's a place that wasn't selling enough wedding dresses so they started selling soup.\n\nI don't want to end on that so I will say that the chicken & tuna salad are fantastic. + Everything here is just kinda meh.. The food is ok, sometimes I worry how long things have sat because nobody is ever here. \n\nIt's nice and convenient if you just need a pop or chips. Other than that I probably won't be trying the food again.\n\nStaff is all very nice though! + This place is perfect for a quick coffee and sandwich. At least 3 different types of coffee everyday, fresh. The menu variety and quality paired with the prices is nearly unbeatable. Some of the nicest, most genuine restaurant staff I've ever met. Very well-kept and the layout is great: two huge garage door style walls that open in the spring\\/summer, stage for live music, private meeting room, and comfortable seating for dining. What else do you need?\n\nLunch gets packed, but it just shows how good it really is. I've only just recently started coming here for my morning coffee and I don't plan on going anywhere else for quite some time! + Working at the far end of the Strip, I'm always on the lookout for something new.  Today I saw that the 26th Street Market and Cafe were officially open, so I popped in for lunch.  \n\nEverything is help yourself, with the exception of their sandwich board.  Essentially it's a one stop shop - get your cigarettes, sandwich, coffee, and candy bar all in one location.  Not a bad thing if you're short on time for a lunch hour.  If you're looking to dine in, they have a large room available to eat your goodies in a very home-like enviornment.  Sure it may have garage doors as windows, but sofas and wooden tables give it a warm feel.  This would be a great venue to have bands come play, too.\n\nI ordered a turkey panini to go, grabbed a bag of chips, and a bottle of iced tea --- yup!  Under $10!  Gotta love it :)  I'll be coming back to try their flatbread pizza or meatball hoagie...\n\nSo far, so good from the 26th Street Market and Cafe"

         "I've given this place a handful of chances (at least 5 visits) but it seems every time I pick up my dog the cut isn't what I asked for, plus other little things here and there that I will explain in this review. It seems that each visit, the face and head are never clipped and shaped how I asked, and the base of the tail is never clipped up the 2 inches like I had asked either. My dog is one of the easiest dogs to groom (spoken by the owner herself), yet somehow always looks different than what I has asked for when I pick her up, so these issues cannot be blamed on a squirmy, difficult\\/misbehaved dog.\n\nThe last two times I requested bows be put in the ears, she said no problem she can do that, but both times my dog got a bandana (not a huge deal but this just goes to show you how they don't really listen to their clients). A one time forgetful mistake I can completely understand, but twice in a row? Ehh, no excuse.\nWrite it down or something if you can't remember.\n\nMy dog's inner ear hairs have never been plucked and her mild tear stains never touched\\/washed when I pick her up either. I've read a truly good groomer will always pluck the ears when needed on certain breeds unless asked not to by the owner. This is very important to do as dogs with hair growing in the ear can easily develop infections such as yeast in the ear due to no air penetrating the ear canal causing moisture to build up. I do this to my dog myself at home with ear powder from the pet store so it isn't a huge deal for my dog and myself, but again, this just shows that what should be done each visit is not.\n\nTruth is I've never said anything because I do not want to be confrontational, plus her prices were so fair. I just thought \"oh well, I'll fix the mistakes at home with my own scissors.\" However the last time I picked up my dog the price jumped up $5 no explanation. So unfortunately I will not be bringing my dog back here if her prices are going to be the same as many other surrounding grooming salons. Not for the consistent mediocre service.\n\nAll in all this isn't a bad place to bring your dog, it's a nice little salon, just don't expect to get what you want out of your pup's hair cut. Because of this I cannot recommend the place. + Took my dog today and I am very disappointed!  My dog is a lab\\/boxer mix and he is 6 months old, we adopted him the end of June so this was his first visit to a Groomer.  Candice had no compassion for my scared puppy, she grabbed his legs several times very hard and also held his mouth shut very tight!  Then muzzled him and still no compassionate words for the scared Pup I was trying to comfort him from behind the counter, where I was almost in tears!  Needless to say we are not going back EVER, and I certainly will not refer anyone to go there! + Don't go if your dog is new to the grooming process or under two years. I don't think she understands puppies and adolescent dogs. + Candace does a great job with our Shih Tzu, Lola. We've been going there consistently for over a year - have never had a problem. She always looks great! + I take my dog here on a regular basis for nail trims.  They are great!  Very accommodating, and always get me in and out in no time.  My dog use to hate getting a nail trim done, but after coming regularly for a few months she is getting use to it and doing well.  I will continue to come here and highly recommend them! + This was my first time at 3 dogs and a cat. The place was clean and Candace was very friendly, they did a great job grooming my dog! I will definitely return and I do recommend this grooming salon! + Please don't put your dog or puppy through the torture.   They are pathetic.    I had 2 wheaten terriers I took there to get cuts.  You would think they would both have the same cuts.   Nope.  They trimmed them down  to nothing. \n   My boy.  She cut his pee..pe.   instead of tell us and owning up to it.   She called us and said he is peeing blood.   Huh\n  All the sudden. Kind of strange .  She said it's a lot of blood.  I think you need to get him to the vet asap.\n  So we did.  And the vet found that he was cut on his penis.    \n   Also after we get them home and look them over the next day.  We find that under his armpits are completely bald and all scabs.   \n   Beside all that.   You would think when you take 2 dogs to a groomer there cuts would look the same.    Nope.    They cut their faces totally different.    My dogs were acting so weird for 2 or 3 days.   It's sad.  \n   You would think if you were just going to buzz them with clippers the length would be consistent.    Not even close\n  I am guessing they're drug addicts.    \n   So I called and told her what the vet said .   And asked what happened to his armpit?   She told me when dogs are bad they can get cut.   \n    Save your money.  My 10 year old little Neighbor girl can cut them like that for a few bucks. + Candice is awesome! I took my sister's geriatric chocolate lab to 3 dogs & a cat and Candice was so good with us. She greeted us in the parking lot and helped Baylie out of the car since she has decreased mobility in her back legs. Candice knew what to expect since she had asked lots of questions about my dog and her needs when I scheduled the appointment.\n\nBaylie has a plastic allergy and some skin issues because of her age. Candice took special care with her trouble spots and sensitive ears . She was also able to clip her nails which is always a battle with Baylie and her most despised part of grooming. \n\nThe salon is welcoming in appearance too. There are pet accessories for purchase in the lobby area. The dog grooming area has a nice homey feel with wood style flooring and finished white and pink walls, it does NOT feel like a vets office with tile and steel accessories, which usually makes Baylie a little hesitant.\n\nAt the end of her visit Candice took time to escort Baylie to the car and help her in. And gave us sone dog treats for the ride home. I felt like Baylie was treated the way Candice would treat her own pets.\n\nOverall great place, with excellent customer service and quality care! We look forward to our next visit. + We took our dog here a few months ago and I plan on making this place my normal grooming location.  My little havanese looked so cute afterwards!"

         "3 Guys Optical",
         "I went to the Oakland location of 3 guys optical last week (corner of Forbes and Atwood). I scheduled for the free eye exam and contact lense fitting (not free), and I did not need to wait at all, which is super nice. The eye doctor (Christie?) was very friendly and professional, and I got my trial contacts right away. I don't know much about eye exam fees and stuff, but for 40 dollars I got an eye exam + contact lense fitting, without having to wait or travel to some random faraway places (in Pittsburgh that is such a pain when you don't have a car), so I thought it was worth it. Plus it's really close to CMU (and UPitt) so I found it very convenient. \nI took one star off, because the frame selections weren't very big. And the good ones cost a lot, especially when you need high index lenses for your glasses. I heard there's a special that's $99 for 2 pairs of glasses, but that offer does not apply to high index lenses, only the regular thick lenses. So if your power is high, be prepared to pay more.\nOverall I had a great experience at the Oakland store, and I would definitely recommend it to students. + The entire staff at this location is wonderful! They are a very busy location but the service they provide is top notch! I went for an eye exam for glasses and the selection was great, you were not rushed through the process. Everything was explained to you fully in regards to the purchase and exam. I was even counseled on solutions to better protect my eye health. Each aspect was done in a courteous and professional manner. This will certainly be my eye care provider of choice! Excellent and way above average service. Also, when I checked in I received a gift of a 3 Guys T-shirt, I thought that was awesome! + Very nice staff. Their selection of eyeglasses is interesting, the realllly nice ones will cost you. Overall, two pairs of glasses for 100 dollars can't be beat. + Eyeglasses are my favorite accessory.  For some women it's shoes or purses or jewelry, but for me it's glasses. I even have an eyeglass fixture that holds all of my glasses. They are my trademark. I'm always on the hunt for unique glasses. \nI was downtown and remembered that this eyeglass store was close to where I was. The store is tiny. They have 2 walls that display glasses but they are small. They also have a freestanding fixture but there are so many pairs in there that it doesn't look good and you can't really see what is in there. \nThey carry brands such as Ray Band, Maui Jim, Fendi, Burberry, etc.  \nYou never know when or where you'll find your next pair of glasses so I'll keep checking in here to see what they have in their small stock. + I'm from out of town and my glasses broke. I call 3 Guys to see if they could fix them. Of course they could. I took them in and left them. By the end of the day they called me to say they where ready. They fixed them for free. I couldn't believe that there are people out there that believe in costumer service. \n\nThank you 3 Guys Optical + I buy a new pair of glasses every year as well as prescription\nsunglasses every few years. This year I decided to go to 3 Guys simply\nbecause of the location.  This turned out to be a great decision! The\nstaff is extremely knowledgable & friendly.  They will work with you\ntrying on frame after frame & even ordering a different frame if you\nknow what you want.  They are really great! Just walk in & you will be\npleased from HELLO!! + Very pleased with the service and my new glasses. Appointment was on time and the exam by Dr.Burke was very well done - he even noted that I was raising my head to look out of the bottom of my glasses. Selecting new frames was easy and an ipad helped me see what I'd look like in the new glasses. Jamie did a comparison of cost using my insurance vs their special for the week. Always happy to save a few bucks.\n\nOverall happy with 3Guys and recommend it. + Initial service was great. Easy exam, super-friendly. However, follow-up warranty service has been a little lacking.\n\nAbout 1 month after purchasing a pair of $350 dollar glasses (with much touted lifetime warranty), the rubber collar on the ear stem split. I stopped in to get a new one, which was ordered. \n\nI heard nothing for a few weeks, so stopped in. I was told the part was on back-order, and they staff person was sorry that no-one had called to tell me. Fair enough. They offered to put a piece of shrink-wrapped plastic on for me. I found this odd - wouldn't it void the warranty? Would it even come off? I declined.\n\nA few weeks alter I called again. My original order staff person was on vacation, so the person I spoke to couldn't tell me much, other than the part did not come in. Meh.\n\nA few weeks later on, still have not heard anything. I call in again, and am told to expect the part next week. This has taken at least two months.\n\nI know they are dependent on Oakley for the parts, but to have to constantly call for an update seems a bit absurd in this age of text messaging and email. I would think also that if they have sold many of these glasses, or had difficulty dealing with Oakley and parts in the past, that information may have informed a different choice in frames. + Came here with a Groupon and left happy! Great customer service and amazing selection. Plus free hot chocolate! Cant go wrong! + I wanted to wait a little while before I wrote this...It has been about two months since I had my exam at 3 Guys and purchased eyeglasses. \n\nI was really excited to try this place, but it didn't send me over the moon like some others had experienced.\n\nI would like to give 3.5 stars.  I think that this location over booked itself because I was waiting for about a half hour before I was seen by the eye doctor. \n\nI went in and was paying cash for all my services.   I picked up a really pretty pair of purple frames but I was told that those of for insurance carriers only... I don't get it.  I thought that cash customers should get to chose whatever frames they would like. \nI felt like a second hand citizens yet again for not having insurance.  The price tag for my glasses and eye exam was about $324.00 .\n\nI am not sure how or why they sale insurance coverage glasses only.  I have never encountered such a thing before.  Does some one care to enlighten me?\n\nAll 3.5 are for my lenses in the two months that I have had them have not scratched once that's pretty impressive and they have a pretty sweet student discount too."

         "Nice little affordable public tract with a lot of up and down holes tracing the hilly terrain. Like a lot of public places, the bunkers need work. There are a number of blind shots so drive your cart up for a looksee if it's your first go round. Prices in the bar\\/restaurant are also decent, and we had a pretty good lunch washed down by two $7 pitchers of Yeungling. Not at all busy on the day we played, which is good if you're playing but bad if you're the owner\\/operator. + One of my favorite public courses in the PGH area. Very well maintained and friendly staff. Overall 4 Star course for the price. + Greens are in great shape however almost every trap had 6 inches of standing water. Fairways were well groomed however everything outside the fairway is falling apart, from Cart paths to tee boxes some work could be done. + I have played this course a few times before and was always somewhat happy.  Yesterday I had a tee time with 2 of my friends that have never played there and I assured them that the $44 green fee would be worth it.  Well I was made out to be a total liar.  When we went in to sign in I asked how the greens were and the answer was \"great, they mowed them and rolled them this morning and should be rolling fast\".  The greens were in the in the worst shape that I have ever seen any course.  The fairways and tee boxes were absolutely terrible.  Standing water in most sand traps.  The only traps that were even maintained with a sandpro were the ones closest to the clubhouse. How convenient. As we finished #2 we almost went in to get our money back and go elsewhere but we continued on and by the time we were done with 9 it was now just a joke.  When we did stop at the turn to get a dog and beer, well that's another story.  Inflated prices for 3 dogs and 1 six pack $26.  \"the hot Dogs are Jumbo\" is what we were told.  After our round we went into the pro shop and told another employee about our disappointment and he just told us that we would have to talk to management.  He did give us each a 9 hole raincheck which we will probably never use.  He agreed that the course is in the worst shape that it has been in over 5 years.  \nI myself spent 17 years in the golf course industry as the head technician in charge of all equipment and have worked for private and public courses.  I know that it was a very hot summer and that diseases can destroy a course very quickly.  My problem is that I paid $44 dollars apiece expecting better conditions based on what we were told at the pro shop.  If you are honest with people about things that you can't control like the summer we just went through and lower your prices I think you would be better off in keeping golfers coming back.  And for the things that you CAN take care of like the sand traps, maintain them so that they look halfway decent and aren't a breeding ground for the mosquitoes.\nAs for ever coming back, both of my friends handed their rainchecks to me and said \"do what you want, we will never be back\". \nVery Disappointed."

The stage was small, but the band was close. And loud. \n\nPlastic skulls line the walls. Signed cymbals on the ceiling. A scrolling neon sign says: F*uck pretty much every other venue in the city. A bulky golieth of a man takes your 5 dollar cover when you enter.\n\nThe crowd is extremely varied and most people smoke. A lot. But all are welcoming. I came in thinking I'd be well out of my element, but left thinking I'd like to stop in again sometime. + This is a kick ass punk rock bar!  Everyone was friendly.  All original music is a guarantee, the bar is decorated with all kinds of cool stuff to check out, the staff is on point, and if I lived in Pitt I would be coming here all of the time.  Only bummer was no food close by, but I wasn't there for the food. + I happened to be in town on business right around the time of the 6\\/26 D.R.I. show, so I got my first taste of the 31st Street Pub during that visit.\n\nThis is one intimate venue, especially if the place is crowded (I'm assuming the show I attended was one of the more crowded ones, as I was told beforehand it was \"almost sold out\").\n\nInside, the place isn't very wide (30-40 feet of available space maybe?), with a bar running most of the length of the building up the right side.  From the very back of the club to the stage appeared to be somewhere between 100 and 120 feet.\n\nThe ambiance in here is \"punk rock dive bar\" through and through.  Posters, flyers and stickers cover almost every inch of available space.  Behind the bar, there was more of the same, but also a long shelf\\/cabinet filled with skulls.  There's also a section of ceiling, from about mid-bar to the end closest to the stage, that has autographed cymbals attached to it.  Acts both big and small have passed through the doors of this place, from the looks of those cymbals.\n\nOther reviews have mentioned the scrolling electronic sign that \"disses\" some of the older Pittsburgh music venues, which was a fun little touch.\n\nThe stage only stands about 18 inches tall, if I had to guess, didn't look to be more than about 20 feet wide, and there was an obstruction on the left of the stage in the form of some speakers.  A musician could easily be obscured behind that thing if they're not into moving around too much.\n\nDespite my concerns, the sound system was up to par, and all of the bands sounded pretty clear.\n\nI had to hit the bathroom twice over the course of the evening, and the men's room was about what you'd expect from a place like this.  It was small (two people could be in there at once, max) and filled with stickers and graffiti.\n\nThere were plenty of cheap beer options, but not nearly enough craft brews for my liking.  There were only two that really caught my eye, and one of them was totally tapped out after I'd only been in the door for about five minutes.  On the plus side, those couple of craft brews were the expensive ones on the list, and only cost $4.50 apiece.  While still expensive considering the average price of a six-pack, it was still way less than the $7-$8 I was expecting to be socked with.\n\nI had a 1.7-mile walk back to my hotel after the show, so I knew I had to keep things in check (beer-wise) if I wanted to get back in one piece.  So I switched to bottled water pretty early on, and was glad to find out they were only a buck apiece.\n\nAll in all, three bottled waters and a single craft brew only ran me $7.50 (minus tips), so it was a pretty economical evening.\n\nCall me a wimp if you must (go ahead, it's okay), but after years and years of clubs prohibiting smoking, it was tough for me to adjust to the fact that smoking was allowed in here.  I was enshrined in a cloud of smoke most of the night from the people around me, and I smelled dreadful (well, more dreadful than usual) when I got back to my room.\n\nBut, enough of all that...\n\nTo sum up, intimacy is the key to a place like this.  There probably isn't a bad spot in the place to watch a band.  Towards the end of D.R.I.'s set, I went to the merch area (right near the entrance), which is about as far as you could be from the stage, and was still able to see everything taking place on stage.\n\nI'm not often in Pittsburgh, but the next time I get an opportunity to see a show here, I'm totally down. + This place is a 21 and up club that caters to the biker and gearhead lot. I drove up to Pittsburgh with the intention of seeing a really good psychobilly show at this pub and amen, I got what the hell I showed up for. The bar itself is a special kind of classy, from the Frankenstein green paint job on the exterior to the glass showcase full of skulls that leads the way to the bathroom, this bar has a great atmosphere. This is a place where any ruffian wishing to relive the glory days of their bad ass biker grand pappy can happily swill down cheap beer and tap their knee to a running bass line in their finest leather jacket. The place is cleanish, crisp, it's a working class bar (between sets they played nothing but The Bruisers, I was in heaven). I'm going to go to more shows here, as many as I can, and I hope more people show up because I want to see the touring bands coffers runneth over.\n\nNotables:\n-They have \"underwear afternoons\" sometimes where bartenders are dressed in lingerie.\n\n-Shows start at 10:00 PM and the whole place is 21 and up.\n\n-You can smoke\n\n-A ton of good shows that run the gamut of excellent underground music. + I LOVE this place. They put on some amazing shows, particularly of the punk\\/rockabilly\\/metal persuasion. They also find awesome local talent. I haven't gone here when there wasn't a concert going on so I can't speak to an average night at the bar but the events were enough to merit a 5. Along with Belvederes, one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. + After walking off a disappointing brief tour of Lawrenceville taverns I decided to give 31st pub a go since I was heading back towards downtown to catch the T.   Purely a no nonsense and stand up establishment here with dark smoky attitude and decor.  There were no bands scheduled but the stage was charming and alluring to my 4 eyes.  Drinks were stiff and beer options while not abundant were suffice.   After chatting with some young long haired bucks they proceeded to play some great tunes on the juke (ZAPPA included)\n\nI will have to return when there is a show and let's just say that if 31st was a dame (and yes that is an outdated yet still a term of endearment in my odd world)  she would be the girl who wears combat boots even during the summer but has a big heart,  But if you betray and disrespect her, those boots are going straight up you arse\\/ into your nuts. hahaha + Over the past score of my life, I have passed the legendary 31st Street Pub an estimated 5,000 times. Yet until the other night, I kept putting off going since the concerts often don't end until after 2am! Thus, I've missed countless gigs, and not without much regret. Long is the tally of what could've been: Church of Misery, The Wildhearts, Byzantine, Absu...ugh. Oh Hecate, I'm about to weep, slapping my calvous skull as I write this. However, last week, I noticed that another band who'd headlined a concert here 2 years ago, one that I also skipped for whatever lame reason, was returning. Until the actual date of the show, I was still wringing my hands...at 7pm. The start time was 9:30! I gazed into the mirror, saying to myself, \"It's on a Friday night! I don't have to get up early tomorrow! My doctor's appointment isn't 'til 11:30! My woman is away for the night! I just got paid! I have Lyft on my iPhone! It's only $10 to get in! I can do this!\"\n\nBefore I could debate with myself further, I was showering, shaving, brushing my teeth, deodorizing, donning my \"good\" black boots, my \"good\" jeans, grabbing some ear plugs, and pulling on one of many concert tour shirts that I own. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was surprised that only one floor was utilized. All of the head-snapping action was to occur in the back of the room. For all of these years, I'd thought the magic happened upstairs. \n\nI looked about nervously. I didn't see anyone I knew...yet. I gazed at the death-themed knick-knacks, guitars, and drum covers that bedecked the walls and ceiling. I cautiously sat at the bar, ordering a Pepsi. A devil doll of a barmaid smirked, brought me a PBR, and said, \"2 bucks. Trust me, it'll regrow hair.\"\n\nHell,I thought the hipsters had completely co-opted Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, driving the price into orbit. Like a house of worship is to vampires, their kind would not be welcome here, but was I? \n\nA sweaty hand planted itself onto my scalp as I sipped on the bitter ale out of politeness. I spun around, my back tingling. I was anticipating a brawl! \n\n\"Hey, maaan! I seen them 20 times,\" A bearded, portly, long-haired gentleman said to me, pointing to my Testament shirt. \"They're cold-blooded.\"\n\nI'd made a new friend in the time it takes to whip up a mixed drink.\n\n\"Anybody gives you shit abaht not havin' no hair, you tell 'em Rob Halford's bald too,\" he advised. \n\n\"But wait, you ain't gay are ya?\" he asked only to explode into a roar of wobbling, cheerful laughter. I grabbed him for fear he was going to fall off his stool. \n\nShortly, friends from the local metal scene were seeping in, shocked that I'd finally showed up here, exclaiming \"It's about damn time\" as they patted my back. \n\n\"Is that...him?\" I asked one of my comrades. \n\n\"Who? Where?\"\n\n\"Over there. Eric Wagner, the former singer of Trouble, hanging out with one of the chicks from Derketa? What's he doin' here?\"\n\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=Kg_hYpdKC64\n\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=pcoCYCSImqs\n\nAlas, it was him. Shyness overcame me, but before I could work up the nerve to say hello, a creepy, clanky, thrash metal ghoulfest was underway, Deceased mastermind King Fowley proving to be one affable ogre of a man, a composite of Hagar The Horrible, Shrek, Homer Simpson, and Gardner's Grendel. \n\nThe stage is close to the floor, making shows not only intimate but interactive. Halfway into the first song on the setlist, Fowley was lurking around the entire bar while vocalizing as I wondered if his cord would be long enough, urging fellow concertgoers to sing along, and you'd better know the words when King calls on you and sticks a microphone into yer yap. \n\nI made the wonderful mistake of standing at the corner of the stage, but the band's energy overcame me. Asudden, I was staggering around like a minion of of Samhain, Lord of the Dead...\n\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=4Ps3L1ETLSc\n\nFowley would don a zombie mask, mock strangling me before the finale, a cover of this seminal track that spawned an entire subgenre...\n\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=fHmzFVDjVnM\n\nAn hour and a half of serrated guitars, flailing mallochios, and guttural screams,  ended with me trapped in a bearhug by Fowley himself, my eyes red from cigarette smoke. \n\n\"You looked like you had a bad-ass time,\"\n\n\"I did, I did.\"\n\n \"How come I never saw ya here before?\" \n\n\"Eh, I dunno.\" \n\nChuckling good-naturedly, the manbeast bid me adieu. Outside, the rain intermittently spat cold droplets upon me as I contacted Lyft for a ride home. I awoke at 10:30, narrowly making my appointment on time, thanking a relative with a reliable car profusely.\n\nThe green cube of brick, wattage, noise, and sweat that is the 31st Street Pub has stood for longer than I've been breathing. Not much is ornate about it. Just enough room is allotted for the bands to do their thing and give Baphomet his due while you just rock out like its your sworn duty, cause it is! Lovers of metal and\\/or punk: Your attendance is mandatory. + There is a sign above the stage and above the bar that says \"Absolutely no covers\". That alone gets this place 5 stars - giving a thriving scene to musicians that create their own work. The ceiling and walls are lined with drum heads and broken cymbals of bands who have rolled through - look hard and you'll see some names that would sell out Stage AE these days. Smoking is a downside, but it's hard to complain about it in a place like this. If you like rock, come on out. The drinks are cheap, too.\n\nAlso, I love the electronic sign above the bar that scrolls through \"fuck *your favorite place here*\". Some of the names on the list shut down years ago - that just makes it even better. + Here's the thing: great live rock venues are a dying breed. Joel's survived by having consistently amazing bands and treating them well. Live music has struggled due to a lot of attention competition in the last 10 years. Living and performing for 10 years in NYC during the '00's, there were few if any club owners that understood how to build and develop loyalty among a scene. Joel and the Pub have managed to withstand the difficulties of economic and cultural change by simply doing one thing brilliantly: present kick ass rock n roll, reasonable drinks, and a nurturing atmosphere. I miss my touring days and I mostly miss playing the 31st Street Pub. Luckily, I still do once a year. Joel --keep the torch lit, and the Jäger cold! + Love it! Great place to see a live show.  The Pub brings some great bands to Pittsburgh. Anything from rock, metal, punk, doom, stoner, if it's loud then it's perfect for this place. It's dark, smokey, skulls, and band paraphernalia everywhere, small bathroom with tons of graffiti.  Perfect rock bar!"

         "365 Hospice",
         "365 Hospice employs extremely compassionate staff.  Recently, a very caring Chaplain Dorothy Stubbs visited my uncle during the final days of his life.  The love and compassion exhibited for my uncle was deeply genuine and very soothing.  In addition, Chaplain Stubbs' concern extended beyond my uncle's soul, but to the family as well.  Not only did she minister to my uncle, she went beyond the call of duty and became his minister.  She officiated his funeral a week later.  \n\nI am very thankful 365 Hospice is committed to hiring caring and compassionate employees! + This is the Best Hospice around. They are very compassionate and kind. They were very helpful, and able to answer all my questions, and we're so kind. Their staff are the best! We could have a Certified Nurses Aide come in every day, and the Nurses came several times a week, and if we needed them more all we had to do was let them know. We would definitely use them again! + Stephanie Barber\n · August 20, 2017\nThis does not even deserve one star. Let me tell you a horrifying story about 365 Hospice. My mother lay dying in her bed at Washington County Health Center from August 10 through August 13th when she passed. Don't ever pass away or even get sick on the weekends especially if you have hired 365 Hospice. We were informed by the hospice nurse on Friday that she was ordering a \"comfort kit\" for my mom along with a patch for throat\\/chest fluids, gurgling and anxiety meds for the weekend. We were also informed that 365 hospice had only two, only two nurses on call for the weekend and that if we needed someone to call. Then they happily marched out of the facility for the weekend. I was assured by both hospice and the front desk at Washington County Health Center that the medications were to be delivered Friday evening. On Saturday, we had family and friends coming to say goodbye. I had questions about my mom's condition at the time and all the answers I received is \"didn't hospice tell you this\", didn't hospice give you the \"Out of Sight' booklet on dying and the end of life process. Early Saturday evening my mom was having gurgling, rattling and congestion issues. I noted that she had not received her patch. I went to the nursing desk of her unit and asked where the meds were. I found out that Washington County Health Center called hospice in the afternoon on Saturday and hospice had never responded. No return call, nothing. I then demanded that they get the meds as soon as possible. I then called hospice and received the answering service. A nurse finally called me back and indicated that yes Washington County Health Center had called and the girl who took the call admitted that but she was so busy it slipped her mind. Really my mother was dying and \"it slipped her mind.\" I then asked that a nurse be with us on Sunday and frankly, there should have been a hospice nurse on staff in both my mother's room and throughout the Health Center the entire weekend that there was no excuse for this. Hospice is supposed to be a compassionate organization to assist both patient and family with comfort during this time. 365 nothing, not one compassionate word, not even an apology. My mother passed away early Sunday a.m. I was informed by the aid at Washington County Health Center that yes that the medicine was delivered but to my mother's former assisted living Mount Vernon of Elizabeth at 11:00 p.m. Saturday night and that the medicine did not finally reach Washington County Health Center until 1:00 a.m. Sunday morning. As a result of the negligence of 365 Hospice my mother did not get the needed medications and\\/or the compassionate care that she deserved. When I spoke with her Chaplain that came to her Mass she stated \"well some times things do fall through the cracks.\" I am sorry but not with my mother. If you are intending on using 365 Hospice for your loved ones, make sure that they have competent staff available on weekends to assist your loved one and their family. Seeing the reviews below, I see that evidently they forgot about my mother."

         "380 Auction Discount Warehouse",
         "I have shopped at 380 Auction for years and I love the eclectic selection of products that are available.  I could spend hours browsing the many rooms and departments, especially the tools and automotive departments.  All at affordable prices + I love places like this. Every time you visit it is like a different store. There are thousands of different items - some you want, some you need, and some you can't even identify. I found cookies I have been looking for for years. I found farmers market vegetables. I found closet supplies, school supplies, auto supplies, HBA, food, some clothing, furniture, plants. They have collectible cookie jars. Every nook and cranny had something new. Most, but not all, of it at prices you'll love. One visit can't be enough but if you wait too long to buy something, it may not be there. Plan to spend some time and just wander! You'll love it. + Don't underestimate this place which looks simply like another agway. This store is filled with tons of items including Steelers stuff, auto care items, tools, garden items, snacks, jewelry, furniture, toys, housewares, and seasonal-specific gifts & decorations. You'd be surprised what you can find in here, and it's much larger than one would think. I love getting my Christmas decorations from here as well as anything that I need for apartment because it's so ridiculously cheap. Also for you Steelers, you won't be disappointed. There's jewelry, handbags, signs, lanyards, and so much more. For those with a  green thumb, you'll love the plant and flower selection in the spring\\/summer months! Just come here, and I'm sure you'll find something you like! + Recently purchased my living room set from 380 auction. I got a good deal on the set I got.  After a couple months with the set I can't say that the quality is all that good.  I already have places where the seems are coming apart.  I was pleased with the shopping experience but I do think a lot of the furniture 380 sells is low quality.  I woud still shop there again. + I got a few things here yesterday: Ever bearing Strawberries, Pink Ranunculus, bee trappers, and lots of Peat Moss.  Bird seed is reasonably priced here.  I was disappointed that I could not get a bird bath or Rhododendron. + I'm quite surprised no one else has written about this little gem.  If you didn't know any better you might just fly on by this place while coming into the city on 380.  It doesn't look like  much from the road but a couple of building in a small valley.\n\nThe myriad of products you may find inside this complex is unexplainable at times.  I mean how do you really categorize this place when they have everything from furniture to plants, kitchenware to auto parts, and pet products to toys.  You can't put this on the same level as Wal-Mart or Target because the prices are way better than both combined.  You actually might feel like you're pulling into a flea market at first, but believe me, what you encounter is way better than any flea market you can find.\n\nThe furniture department in here is quite extensive.  They offer delivery for a small fee but you are more than welcome to pick the item up yourself.  Their newest room located in the back is like their seasonal room, depending on what season\\/holiday it is determines the products available.  \n\nThe knickknacks available in here can tickle your fancy for sure.  I'm sure if you were to walk in here you'd end up finding something you really don't need, but want.  \n\nAt times there can be a vendor outside selling some type of food from hot dogs to pizza.  Check outs are throughout the place, I believe even one outside so you don't need to go inside to pay for your plants.  \n\nCarts available, credit cards accepted, fun to be had. + Stopped at 380 Auction this past weekend as I do every year around this time of the season for their mammoth selection of plants and flowers.  Years ago, I used to go to a local nursery that I absolutely loved but has since closed.  Intermittently, I had tried to purchase plants through big box stores, other nurseries, and some department stores with little luck when it comes to quality, selection, and price.  That's that trifecta for an amateur gardener who thinks she's much better than she is...\n\nI digress.  380 not only has a huge selection of vegetation they also offer a ton of other items, none of which are ever put up for auction.  This is one of those discount stores that can be distressing for someone like me.  Not severely organized, offering everything from furniture and mattresses, to toys and food.  Definitely a mish-mash of things.  I usually don't go inside, only weave and duck my way through the mass crowds out to score the deals and the daylilies.       \n\nI scored four hanging baskets, several varieties of vegetables, enough to fill my two gardens, several flowers to plant in beds and pots, and some mushroom manure.  All this was under $100.00, and I don't need to purchase another plant for the rest of the season.  My garden looks good and I didn't break the bank.  Totally worth a stop if you're in the area.  Note the parking lot is awful, and on busy days you have to park up the hill.  No fun.  But they do curbside loading so that helps. + Love this treasure tucked away down slope off Highway 380 near the intersection of 286 and 380.  \n\nShopped there both Saturday and Sunday of Mother's Day weekend for outdoor plants to get the summer kicked off in style.  \n\nOh word!  The parking lot was full and cars were parked clear up to 380.  Not deterred, I forged ahead and experience good karma -- both \"carma\" as in someone backing out right near the entrance right when it was my turn to grab it and in the length of the cashier line not once but twice as I paid for my full grocery cart's worth of plants then made another trip.  Both times on a Saturday the line was never more than 5 deep. (Sunday was a whole different story -- the line wrapped and weaved so much that we aborted that plant trip and opted for inside shopping instead.)   \n\nThe plants were healthy and price way cheaper than anywhere else I shopped (this weekend being Lowe's and Stanford Home Center).  That is, all except for the Bleeding Hearts -- those here were all broken, Stanford's were healthy but more expensive, and Lowe's were healthy and huge and in bloom for 7.98.  But all else -- you can't beat the prices -- 8.99 for gigantic hanging baskets for example.  And everything is organized so well -- all sectioned off -- perennials, annuals, herbs, etc.  \n\nIndoors is a virtual plethora of \"stuff\" and more \"stuff\" in many rooms -- cheap \"stuff\".  A note -- if you see something you like, grab it now.  Why?  Because you'll never remember where you saw it if you try to go back for it later.  It's not \"exactly\" as clearly organized as outdoors.  What kind of \"stuf\"?  All kinds of \"stuff\" -- socks, underwear, gardening gloves, puzzles but no Sudoku (sad face), coffee tables and sofas, windshield wipers and oil for your car, pickles and clam chowder, pet food, bird seed, and so much more.  \n\nIf nothing else, just take a gander and look around at least once.  Just a fun throw-back to yesteryear's type of stores if nothing else.  That and oh, the outdoor plants!  This is the first place you should go (if the line isn't wrapped around the entire place) to check out their prices on what you might need. + This review is for the little food stand outside of 380 Auction. The food is amazing and the customer service is even better! I got a pulled pork sandwich with slaw, macaroni salad, and a drink for $4! It tasted amazing and was a great bargain. Next time I go here I'm definitely getting food again!"

We usually call ahead to make an appointment since there are so many of us and they have always been able to accommodate. Just be sure to bring a cash tip because there is not a section to add one with your card! + I just moved to Oakdale and needed a new mail shop,  I found this little gem... they now have a new customer! + This is the first place I've found within 30 miles that is clean, professional and amazing at what they do! Alvin is my man! I am in the field myself and I've been shocked at how dirty many nail salons have been. I've never been this impressed. + I had my SnS nails done by Henry , it's beautiful and perfect. I am very happy w my service, thank you Henry, love the people there, you all should give it a try too, I will come back. + I went in for a gel manicure and was taken by the woman at the back right corner station of the salon.  Her only form of communication with me was grunting and she painted all the skin around my nails which then started peeling within the next 1-2 days.  Perhaps if a patron got one of the other nail techs he\\/she would have a much better experience, but for me it was a waste of money.  $27 was the price for the gel manicure. + I have gotten several gel manicures here (just on my regular nails), and I am always very pleased. They do such a great job of pushing your cuticles back and painting the whole nail without getting any on the skin. My manicures last a solid two weeks and rarely start peeling. I get a lot of complements on my nails when I get them done here! And you can't beat $27 for gel. I highly recommend this place! + Amazing nail technicians!! I am always happy when I leave and every \"Pinterest challenge\" I give them, they deliver!!! + I really enjoyed this nail salon. It's one of the better one's that I've been to in the Pittsburgh region. I was able to walk-in on a saturday for a full set. Nobody pushed me to get gel color, and I've found some salons get really pushy. A full set was only $25 before tip. I got traditional polish, THe acrylics were put on well, I'm a two weeks and I'm ready for a fill, but they're not peeling or coming off. The only downsides were polish was put on so-so, and the technician seemed very distracted, he never said a word to me. \n\nOverall I'll be back if nothing else for the cleanliness, and the price. I'd recommend to a friend. Next time I'll probably splurge for gel polish just because I find it goes on better regardless of the tech. + Beautiful nails, terrible service \\/ overall experience. More than a week in advance, I called to schedule appointments for myself and two friends to get mani-pedis (all at the same time). Day of, we arrived early but weren't acknowledged for 30+ minutes. After that, our services were dramatically staggered--meaning all of our manis and pedis started and ended at different times. Wouldn't have been a big deal if we'd walked in on a whim, but these appointments had been scheduled and confirmed. Nails looked great, but we didn't end up leaving the salon until more than three hours after our scheduled appointment time. Overall the value wasn't worth the amount of time we spent there.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is a normal thing (I rarely get my nails done), but the nail tech was pushing my cuticles down with his own fingernail. Seemed marginally strange and unsanitary to me."

         "Wing specials on Monday through Wednesday nights with the best wings I've had in the Burgh.  The ribs from the weekend sidewalk BBQ are fantastic, some of the best I've ever had.  I've never been disappointed with the food here. Kind of a strange environment, it feels like a neighborhood bar but with some shady characters always hanging around.  Love the food though. + I went to this place because of a Groupon offer and the reviews on yelp were positive.  I was very let down.  \n\nI assumed the atmosphere would be pretty good as others claimed, but it sucked.  The room is one big open room, that is dimly lit.  Being so large, it lacked any sort of cozy intimacy and the dingy light reminded me more of going out to a dive bar for a beer special.  That was reinforced by all of the wall decorations coming from the Miller Light or Coors catalogs.  Around 8:30, a band who was playing in the connected pub started and it was loud enough that it was annoying to talk over. \n\nThe food almost reached average for a comparable place.  I got a burger since I hadn't had one in a while and left unsatisfied.  To be fair, my last burger was at Tessaro's, which is fantastic, but here it was heavily spiced (lots of garlic and other spices) to the point that the flavor of the beef was lost.  The worst part was that at $9, the burger was riding solo with no fries, vegetables, mashed potatoes, or anything.  My friends were similarly underwhelmed with their meals.  \n\nOverall, I saw this as a restaurant trying to portray itself as cross between a pub and a nicer restaurant,  but ended up doing neither well.  I won't be going back. + I went to Frankie and Georgies because a friend of mine was playing in the band that was performing that night. I heard from different people that the food was good and the atmosphere was fun, so I was excited to try this place for the first time. \nFirst off, the way this place is set up is schizophrenic. When you walk in, you're greeted by a dart board- just the thing to walk into the path of. The place is dingy with no real style. There's a long bar on the right as you walk in, and a strange area of booths on the left. Then, the restaurant opens into a large room with tables and more awkwardly placed booths and a stage for bands. In that area, there is a set of a few stairs and a hole cut into the wall that i think led to more tables, but I didn't go up there- it looked all lit up and decorated completely different from the rest of the place. It was almost like the restaurant (if you can call this glorified bar a restaurant) expanded, but each time someone different decorated that area. Plus, the bathrooms were scary, and I couldn't figure out where the kitchen was (where was the food coming from???).\nThe beer selection was average- mainstream beers and a few craft choices- and the prices were okay. As for the food, the menu is filled with greasy appetizers, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, hoagies, and a few entree choices. \nI would have loved to try their pizza, or some appetizers, but the waitress informed us that they were out of most of the appetizers I asked for, and the pizza guy had left for the night and so there was no pizza. After looking over the menu, I asked her if they had meatballs for the meatball hoagie, and she gave me a look like \"hey dummy, of course we have meatballs,\" which was funny since they were out of 3\\/4 of their menu at 8pm on a Wednesday night- excuse me! 10 minutes later, the waitress informed me they were out of meatballs (I can't make this up), so I ordered a mushroom steak hoagie and fries. Surprisingly, the steak sandwiches almost on par with a Philly cheese steak, and the small order of fries was huge, crisp, and tasty, so I'm giving Frankie and Georgie's 2 stars for okay food.\nBy the way, if you're looking for good service, forget it. The lone waitress was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and therefor made for slow service. The blond bartender chick was even worse- surly, slow, and when I asked her for a menu, she literally threw it at me from across the bar. \nI won't be going back- unless my friend is performing again. + Good Prices And Portions, Can Barely Hear The Bowling Alley\n\n4 Wood Grille (on Forward Ave, get it?) was a nice find.  It's an attractively decorated space that offers good food with pretty decent portions.  The only downside?  It's located right under Forward Bowling Lanes, so you occasionally hear when someone makes a strike.  Or drops a bowling ball.\n\nI ordered the salmon fillet ($16), which was well-portioned, and slightly crispy on the outside (just the way I like it).  The fillet comes with a salad (fine), rice (fine), and a side.  I ordered steamed broccoli, which was not over-cooked and well seasoned.\n\nMy partner ordered the smaller strip steak ($21) and was also pleasantly surprised with the portion.  The steak was well-seasoned and cooked the right amount.  His steak came with soup (Tortilla -- excellent) and he chose a twice-baked potato for his side.  We'd recommend against the twice-baked potato.  It was small, lonely, and plain-tasting.\n\n4 Wood grill is a nice upscale restaurant.  It's about the same price as Gullifty's, but the food's way nicer and the atmosphere is more upscale.  I recommend it. + For all intents and purposes, I appreciate 4 Wood Grille (now Frankie & Georgie's) as a good 'yinzer classy' restaurant and bar.  By 'yinzer classy,' I mean that it's not the place you take your date to propose, but it can be the place you take him on your second date, when you're looking for some good, cheap food and want to throw back a few strong beverages before getting onto the rest of your night.\n\n4 Wood is connected to PD's Pub, and now that PD's has gone non-smoking (woohoo!), this is no problem.  If it's a non-peak time and you want to sit in the restaurant side, you may have to wait a moment for the bartender to come over to get your order, but you can be assured that she will make you some badass drinks to go with your meal.\n\nWe tried their specialty on our last visit, the Italian egg roll.  It's actually in a shell that is the consistency of a real Chinese egg roll, but filled with the stuffings of a good, hearty pizza.  Yes, that's right, pizza egg rolls.  Can't say I'd be able to get it every time without my arteries totally jumping ship on me, but it's a nice indulgence treat!\n\nTypically, we get the salads here, sometimes with extra fries, because the fries are awesome.  If you've ever been to Coney Island and gotten fries from Nathan's original hot dog stand, you will appreciate the fries at 4 Wood.  So crispy and starchy.  Yum!  Really good Italian dressing, too, and fresh veggies on the salad.\n\n4 Wood is right underneath Forward Bowling Alley, so you do hear some pins knocking around if it's otherwise quiet in the restaurant.  But for me, that brings back nice nostalgic memories of going to Musik Innovations as a kid with my mum, where they had a similar bowling-noise problem.  I think it just adds to the experience.\n\nAlso, as some others have mentioned, 4 Wood does deals with GroupOn and Living Social, and there are coupons in other local Pittsburgh spots like Clipper magazine.  Go.  Get a bottle of wine and some French fries, and don't feel guilty if you wear your old Bettis jersey.  You'll find something you love! + This should be called Frankie's and Georgie's now. Me and my friend went there because of Groupon deal: $15 for $30 food. The area didn't look safe and the restaurant looked a little scary for us when we stepped in around 7pm. Because there's no customer at all this early. But the bartender served us very friendly. They run out many options on the menu, but there are still many choices left. The restroom is clean but not well furnished. Funny is they give hand sanitizer as soap... So far, it didn't sound like a pleasant place, but the great service, big amount of food, awesome taste made me give them 5 stars!\n\nFood ordered within $32:\n2 salad\n10 wings\nlarge onion rings\nlarge steak pizza (the best pizza I had except the ones in Pizza Hut China)\n\nThe Groupon deal is on until 12\\/31\\/2013, in case you want to try. Since I don't work for Groupon...search by yourself... + Prior to moving from Pittsburgh, my wife and I purchased a groupon at the Four Wood Grille. I did not have high expectations of the restaurant, but never thought that it would be so terrible that I would be unwilling to spend my entire groupon! (I was afraid of food poisoning so we left)\n\nTheir food is horrible, tables are empty, and I believe that almost everything they serve comes out of a nasty dirty freezer. (They couldn't even make their \"menu signature\" drinks because they lacked the ingredients.)\n\nThis restaurant should be on the food network under \"Kitchen Nightmares.\" \n\nDon't eat here. Please, don't eat here. If you bought a groupon for them, just burn it; its truly that horrible and not worth the health risk.\n\nTRULY THE WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE VISITED IN TWO DECADES!!!!  KUDOS TO THEM!!!!! + This was easily the worst restaurant experiences I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. We debated between this and the adjoining P.D.'s Pub (same owners), and I think we made the wrong decision. \n\nWe both ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich, which was extremely dry and chewy, causing neither of us to finish. It also didn't come with anything else, which made the $8 price tag a bit much. In general the menu looks overpriced considering the atmosphere and quality we experienced.\n\nAs mentioned above, it attaches to the bar and the door was open between the two, allowing some smoke to come into the restaurant. It was probably open because there was only one server for both (one of the owners, I think), which was another issue. She was nice, but service was slow because of the conversations she was holding with customers. \n\nWe were there on a Saturday night, and the bowling alley above was VERY loud. This is unexpected and frankly unacceptable for the type of restaurant they clearly wish to be. \n\nAll in all the experience was so bad it was almost comical. And I really wanted to like this place! + This \"establishment\" doesn't even deserve one star. Is there a way to make it zero? I went there today and none of the staff was anywhere to be seen. We waited for 10-15 minutes and no one waited on us, even though we could hear them yelling (and yes, I do mean yelling) in the back. They were screaming profanities downstairs\\/in the stairwell along with that. We could also hear noises upstairs that sounded just as strange. What a joke. How they can call themselves a professional business is beyond my comprehension. And to go along with that, the restrooms looked like they hadn't seen a mop\\/lysol\\/anything clean whatsoever in months. Dear 4 Wood, your mouths are filthy, your building is filthy, so maybe it's a good thing we didn't have to taste your food. + Now Frankie and George's. I thought I'd check out the lower end of Squirrel Hill for once. A dive's a dive, but this place is gross and destined to fail. Empty on a friday night. Worst burger of my life. Dirty. Felt like I was organizing a mob deal my whole time there."

         "I recently took my wife's neglected 2008 Jeep Commander in for a sprucing up. Due to work schedules and other family requirements the last time I have thoroughly cleaned her Jeep was approx 4 years ago. Since then, our version of cleaning was running it through an automatic car wash, which as you know doesn't do much. The years of accumulated grime was destroying the paint and making the Jeep look undesirable. In addition to the outside appearance, the inside was just as bad thanks to my two sons who treat it as their personal trash bin. I was honestly very skeptical that anything could be done to make my wife's vehicle look nice again, but 412 detailing assured me It would look as good as new. When I arrived to pick up the Jeep my jaw dropped. It literally looked like it did the first day I bought it and most importantly, my wife was happy. 412 Detailing did a great job at making a very neglected SUV look great again. + I love my car and try and take super good care of it. But, I have terrible depth perception, bad luck and zero patience. My car is usually clutter free on the inside, but that doesn't mean it's clean. I have a short haired dog that often takes trips with me and she sheds everywhere. I lack the patience to attempt to get all the hair out of my car. I also fail miserably at removing all her slobber from every window possible. As far as the outside, I've been hit with carts in parking lots, keyed, scratched by my own work keys, and even scratched the front bumper pretty badly by hitting another cars wheel well. Those scratches I chalked up to never coming out and having to repaint. Until I took my car to 412 Detailing. Cory got the interior of my car absolutely spotless, including my floor mats that I myself had tried scrubbing to no avail. And the outside? Wow! When I first saw it I was convinced it was a different car. The horrific scratches on my bumper were GONE!!! It was wonderful. And it's very fairly priced. I will be going back to him again! + My BMW was in serious need of some good detailing.   I had several scratches and marks on it from years of Pittsburgh weather, rough driving and drive thru car washes. I thought at best it would look a little nicer after the detail.   When I went to pick up the car,  I thought it was replaced with a different new BMW.  My car hasn't been that shiny since the day I got it!  The interior was clean and smelled fresh.  The price was very reasonable.  I will definitely be back to have my other vehicles detailed!"

         "this cozy little spot was an actual dream, we ended up buying an arrangement from here last minute because he was in the process of making them and they were beautifulllll!! I got the golden milk and my mom got the lavender latte (that wasn't the name but I can't remember) we also got two truffles & a piece of ricotta cake. All was delicious and the inside made me feel like I was in a beautiful floral fairytale. Highly recommend dropping by and experiencing this stunning interior and delicious (and unique) drink choices! + 4121 Main has some excellent drink options. They have a limited menu, are on the pricey side, and are confused about their identity (coffee shop, flower shop, something else). But, they make some truly delightful lattes. + 4121 Main is one of my absolute favorite cafés, if just for the coffee itself. They offer classic drinks but also seasonal, floral-infused lattes (which are delicious). The location is nice as well, because it's just a 10 minute walk down the street and you're in a nice strip of shops in Lawrencville.\n\nThe best part: the INTERIOR. Holy wow. Beautiful. A+. The owners are also florists, and that shows--beautiful seasonal arrangements and decorations. \n\nI can't rave enough about this cafe. (Please sponsor me 4121 Main I'll love you forever) + This unassuming coffee shop right by the Children's Hospital is the perfect spot to stop by before work. The staff are very friendly. The interior makes me feel at home and I loved how they also sell flowers and decor items. The only downfall is that there is no free wifi. I'm definitely stopping by before my weekend shifts in the future. + I heard about this place several weeks ago on the news when the local water company was affecting businesses in the East End. So I decided to wait until the crisis was long over and then visit. I was able to park in permit area where you get a free hour. That is essentially all you need here.\n\nThe place is beautiful when you walk in and very tiny. They sell coffee. loose leaf teas and small baked goods. In addition I was told that they offer full floral arranging for a special event such as a wedding. All merchandise is available for sale. In addition to plants and flowers, they sell soaps, candles, high end candy bars (I was told these are not the same candy bars you find at a competitor in the Strip district), pots, pottery, and silk art to name a few.\n\nI am still wrestling with this cold so the lady suggested a tea for me to try. She recommended a mint and ginger tea to help clear my sinuses. She told me that if I have it there I get a glass pot to go with it. Cost whether you take out or enjoy it there is $3.00.\n\nAll they have are bar stools but they are a little wobbly so I would advise be careful. I looked over some of the artwork on the wall and learned that the other man who works here makes those pieces which are for sale. Outdoor seating is available but limited.\n\nThe tea was just what I needed to provide me with relief from my cold symptoms. It is located on a not too busy street so it is quite easy to miss. Still I truly enjoyed looking at all the beautiful arrangements they had and it had that calming effect when you just want to unwind and relax. Their tea is loose leaf and is also for sale.  Located midway between Lawrenceville and Bloomfield off Penn Ave it is a charming place to get away from it all. + Grabbed a Maple Lavender Latte from this place earlier today. Really tasty. The decor and atmosphere inside is really cool and they have a lot of local made items for sale. \n\nI'll definitely be back. + Such an adorable little cafe! No where else in the city can you find a coffee shop that's also blooming with flowers. The space is small but cozy. The lack of wifi inhibited me from getting any work done, but it's definitely a great spot to catch up up with a friend or a good book. \n\nThe drinks are overpriced for what you get. An iced matcha latte was roughly $5. If you're a matcha fan, I highly recommend it. They also have a large list of alternative dairy products like soy, almond, and macadamia milk. + I had been dying to try this place out for a while when I finally got the chance to visit. The decor was just as I had seen on Instagram. It was cute, quirky, and welcoming! \n\nHowever, the service was not as I had experienced at the other coffee shops here in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel very comfortable enjoying my latte while talking with my friend. The customer service just wasn't very friendly. That being said, I definitely will be back because the coffee and flowers were amazing! I hope next time to feel more at ease. + My favorite little place in the city! They have a good selection of coffees and teas, as well as a variety of unique coffee beans for purchase. This is definitely not the place to come to if you're looking for a place to do work since there's no wifi and the space is pretty small!\nI love their collection of local soaps, chocolates, and other Pittsburgh-made goods. Their wallpaper and art changes every so often when a new artist takes over, and they always have fresh flowers! They have the most gorgeous bouquets for purchase during special times of the year (Mother's Day, Valentine's Day) and do special orders as well! + Oh my goodness! What a find! I had the best warm drink, Golden Milk, served by two lovely ladies. While one put together flower arrangements, the other described the very unusual truffles she makes and offers.  It's a teeny place packed with greenery and garden items, artsy pieces, delicious and unusual hot beverages and truffles. I will definitely return!  Apparently you can learn more about their updated offerings on Instagram."

I am confused on why this place was not more crowded. The food and service was terrific. The menu was exceptional. I most certainly will return - soon. + If you like good food prepared with creativity and is a taste treat and pared with the perfect adult beverage along with service from kind human beings; then Walnut is for you. The owner Joe came over and introduced himself and was concerned if our dining experience was up to par. He even brought us a desert, that was a slice of delicious-ness! Our wait person Erin gave us guidance and was on point. She answered all of our questions with gusto! We are new to the area and are now devotees of Walnut, and look forward to many more dinners with great wine and conversation. Try the stuffed banana peppers, you will not be disappointed. Yum 5 out of 5... + So, I was a little skeptical coming to some little place 'in the middle of nowhere', but sometimes those little hole in the wall places are some of the best. As soon as we (my mom and I) came in the door the staff politely greeted us and brought us two a nice little booth. Throughout the entire course of the meal, the staff was attentive and proactive in checking on us to see if we were satisfied or needed any refills as well. And now I'll talk about the food. \n\nHere's what my mom thought:\nThe Italian meatball soup was amazing and so filing. Also had the largest chicken Caesar salad which was also amazing. And to top it off a nice White Russian hit the spot. Great place, great food and wonderful service and staff! A must if you're visiting Sewickley!!!  \n\nMy thoughts:\nI really just had a mixed greens salad which was pretty good, but I'm not really used to all that high class stuff. The Italian Chicken Breast I had was EXCELLENT! You know food is cooked well when you can taste each of the ingredients playing off one another, and I definitely could with this one!\n \nOverall, the service, food, and atmosphere were amazing!! + Tip: call and make a reservation. Sometimes during the weekend this place is packed! There is bar seating though, so even if you call ahead you can ask the hostess if it's packed. \n\nMy experience: It is pretty good! I've been here twice and have ordered a special twice. Last time I was here they had Delirium Tremens on tap so I was a super happy camper. This time, no luck but I'm still happy with the selection. No real cocktail list and I was told they're working on creating a wine list. There is supposedly a list on the chalkboard by the bar but it isn't legible at all. I stuck with beer because they have a list that is legible.\n\nI ordered the queen size prime rib (HUGE) medium rare (a special on the menu) with a sweet potato and French onion soup to start. The French onion soup was pretty good. Be sure to ask for some bread on the side. They have a tasty sourdough excellent for dipping. \n\nI have always received excellent service here. Our waiter was pretty nice. The owner, Joe, is great. Had a conversation with him. Very attentive. I would definitely come back and invite a couple of friends!!! Hidden gem. + We have been here a few times now and have had great service ,Jerry was our waiter very attentive .The food was fantastic ,I asked for scallops and Gorgonzola pasta they were not on the menu ,but I had them before. No problem they made them for me and they were Excellent .Atmosphere is always fun and busy I highly recomend !!!! + Beautiful space and really enjoyed our meal here. Staff was super friendly and the owner was out making sure everything was amazing -  which it was! Especially enjoyed the grilled haloumi with grilled veggies - they were so smoky and flavorful would definitely get this again. Their Caesar salad was super refreshing and tasty.  I ordered the special lamb shank that was so tender and melted in your mouth!  It was served over a creamy and flavorful mushroom risotto that was the perfect accompaniment to the lamb.  Great meal - would definitely come back! + Pleasantly surprised with our lunch, initially went based on the variety on their menu, yet had many lunch specials which were very good. Crab stuffed artichokes were great, the grilled beet & pear salad with shrimp was very nice and very filling.\nMy kids had the pasta special disk also very good. The waiter was very knowledgable and addressed our needs well. I would go back when I'm back in Pitt visiting RMU. + Food was a little bland. I got the stuffed salmon and I needed to add salt and pepper to it. Others in our party ordered the stuffed eggplant Parmesan and they liked it a lot. One other person in our party had the veal and peppers and it needed salt and pepper. The chicken soup had fat on the chicken and was not tasty. + Five star all the way! Food, quantity, quality, presentation, wait staff, decor, music, selections, can't say enough good things. \nA tad expensive for a lunch, but spend the $$, you won't be disappointed."

         "I keep giving this place a chance and I keep crossing my fingers that it will be good. Its close to my office so its easy and convenient but its just always something. I have always thought the price of food was rather steep for what you're getting. Sandwiches are usually around 8 dollars, with chips, add TWO dollars for a 50 cent potato sliced up and deep fried. But, convenient, so I kept returning. Until one day the health inspector was there and I ordered a white pizza because i had heard their white pizza was good. The cheese on the pizza was rotten. I could smell it the minute they set it down. I quietly told the bartender who took it and took it off my bill. I asked for a club sandwich (NO CHEESE) to go. I was charged for it. How do you serve a customer rotting food then charge them for what you're replacing it with?? Next time around was today. I ordered a cheeseburger. Simple, right? The entire thing was raw except the burnt outside. I think I have officially given up. How many chances can you give a place before you throw up your hands and move on? It's interesting to see all the positive comments here. Is someone filtering\\/deleting the negative? Because I have heard A LOT of terrible things about this place lately...hmmmm + Great cheesesteak! Better than Jim's  in Philly.  What makes it great? It's not overwhelmed with too many green pepper or onions. I love some GP & 0s, but what 4th did very nicely is added red peppers to balance the flava!  The Bonus for this \"bar food\" joint is homemade food and cheap drinks. $2 beers, $5 Long Islands...sure can melt away a stressful day with the madness and loonies at work. Next food to check out on the next visit will be the wings (hoping they're not small) and an Italian sandwich. Sure is hard to find one that doesn't have too much bread. I will let you know. My friend gave the thumbs up on the patty melt. My other friend said the pizza was good, but not spectacular.  We will be back! + Wings were fatty, fries were undercooked, and the hot sauce on the wings had an overpowering vinegar taste.  The staff was nice and Wed night is .40 wings, but that's all it really had going for it. + Visiting the Pittsburgh area for work. Wasn't in the mood for chain restaurant cuisine. Saw the 4th ave grille web page and decided to give it a try. Wasn't disappointed! Bartender Amy was friendly and provided great service. I ordered a burger and homemade fries. Cooked perfect with great flavor. Great bar burger! The place was decorated for the holiday season with Xmas music playing in background. Give this place a try....... + Stuck halfway down this one-way street is the 4th Ave Grille. Clean, bright and cheerful, a beacon of light on an otherwise drab and dark road. A full menu (not much for Vegetarians sadly, except for pasta) serves up decent food at great prices with solid service and bargain-priced booze.\n\nWhat pushed this over the edge into favorite-land for me was the single girl who came in for a beer and a plate of nachos. She claimed she hadn't eaten all day and after a long workday was starved. The bartender hustled to get her a menu and a cold one and she relaxed quietly and happily into a corner.\n\nGives me  warm fuzzies inside to know  this is the kind of place a girl could come on her own and not worry bout a thing, baby. + Great little bar in Coraopolis- you can expect tasty food, a laid back atmosphere, and friendly staff (plus it's non-smoking)! + I normally don't write these but I had a very bed experience here this past weekend. Bartenders and regular guests were very rude to my boyfriend and I when we arrived for a specialty event. Clearly a \"locals\" bar. Wouldn't go there if you're not a regular because you're probably not welcome. + Went there for the first time in three years...my reason for the gap was part service and part food.  Sorry For the gap!\n\nWent for happy hour.  Bartender was very friendly and knew my friends (quasi regulars) drinks of choice.  They have four beers on tap and many craft brews in bottles.  \n\nOrdered food.  Previous complaints were the lack of sauce on the wings.  Decided against the wings this time and opted for a sandwich.  Steak and egg sandwich was fantastic with fresh cut that were also excellent.  Everything was cooked perfect.\n  \nFood and drink was priced reasonably.  Based on my service and food quality I will return soon.\n\nThanks for a great visit! + Best chili I've ever had. Very good food. Good attitude.\n\nJust recently relocated to Coraopolis and this is a new hangout. \n\nProbably the only negative is the smokers by the door. I hate that anywhere. + Always have had good service here pretty good food and good prices.  I went for the first time about two years ago and have gone back twice since so the food cannot of been that bad,  Ha ha kept me coming back"
